Jones' oxidation of 17 beta-hydroxy compounds gave the 17-keto-4-azasteroids, which were treated with amines and NaBH(OAc)3/NaBH3CN to give 17 beta-(N-alkyl/arylamino)-4-azasteroids 10-27. Alternatively, the above-indicated compounds were prepared from amines and 17-keto-4-azasteroids to form imines, which were then reduced with NaBH4. Formylation of amines 10-27 gave 17 beta-(N-alkylformamides) 28-41; however, acylation afforded 17 beta-[(N-alkyl/aryl)alkyl/arylamides] 42-53.

On the other hand, formamides 32 (N-heptyl) and 33 (N-octyl), in addition to inhibiting the type I enzyme (IC50s = 9.57 and 16.9 nM, respectively), showed also strong inhibitory activity (IC50s = 14.0 and 18.4 nM, respectively) for human type II 5 alpha-reductase, in comparison to N-(1',1'-dimethylethyl)-3-oxo-4-aza-5 alpha-androst-1-ene-17 beta-carboxamide (MK-906; IC50 = 4.53 nM).

Affinity data at A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors in bovine brain membranes showed that the 3'-C-modification in adenosine resulted in a decrease of the affinity at all three receptor subtypes. When this modification was combined with N(6)-substitution with groups that induce high potency and selectivity at A(1) receptor, the affinity and selectivity were increased. However, all 3'-C-methyl derivatives proved to be very less active than the corresponding 2'-C-methyl analogues. The most active compound was found to be 3'-Me-CPA which displayed a K(i) value of 0.35 microM at A(1) receptor and a selectivity for A(1) vs A(2A) and A(3) receptors higher than 28-fold. 2'-Me-CCPA was confirmed to be the most selective, high affinity agonist so far known also at human A(1) receptor with a K(i) value of 3.3 nM and 2903- and 341-fold selective vs human A(2A) and A(3) receptors, respectively. In functional assay, 3'-Me-CPA, 3'-Me-CCPA, and 2-Cl-3'-Me-IB-MECA inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with IC(50) values ranging from 0.3 to 4.9 microM, acting as full agonists. A rhodopsin-based model of the bovine A(1)AR was built to rationalize the higher affinity and selectivity of 2'-C-methyl derivatives of N(6)-substituted-adenosine compared to that of 3'-C-methyl analogues. In the docking exploration, it was found that 2'-Me-CCPA was able to form a number of interactions with several polar residues in the transmembrane helices TM-3, TM-6, and TM-7 of bA(1)AR which were not preserved in the molecular dynamics simulation of 3'-Me-CCPA/bA(1)AR complex.","Synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling of ribose-modified adenosine analogues as adenosine receptor agonists.","Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors| Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists| Receptors, Purinergic P1| Ribose| Adenosine",,11,19,1562,,0022-2623,5,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Adenosine| Adenylyl Cyclase Inhibitors| Animals| Binding, Competitive| Brain| CHO Cells| Cattle| Cricetinae| Cricetulus| Humans| In Vitro Techniques| Models, Molecular| Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists| Radioligand Assay| Rats| Receptors, Purinergic P1| Ribose",analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| metabolism| chemistry| chemistry,04,11,15743197,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1550,48,2005,2015,,,,,"Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Molecular Modeling of Ribose-Modified Adenosine Analogues as Adenosine Receptor Agonists",journal-article,10.1021/JM049408N,,"{""MAG"": ""2019566862"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM049408N"", ""CorpusId"": 26472375, ""PubMed"": ""15743197""}",15743197,JournalArticle,bee0ca672f0c3d7ff74a705c2997b63272b1660b,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Monosubstitution of the piperidine ring with Me, OH, NH-Ac, or CONH2 groups gave compounds equipotent to 7a (ML 10302), a 5-HT4 receptor agonist previously reported to have nanomolar affinity. 7a,k were as potent as serotonin (5-HT) but had maximal responses which were only 60-80% of that of 5-HT, suggesting a partial agonist profile for these compounds. Binding assays were performed with [3H]GR 113808 in the rat striatum, and several of these compounds were found to have nanomolar affinity for 5-HT4 receptors (7a, Ki = 1.07 +/- 0.5 nM; 7k, Ki = 1.0 +/- 0.3 nM).

The advantage of the ester function was demonstrated by comparing the activity of several such compounds at 5-HT4 receptors with those of the corresponding amidic derivatives. This difference was less marked when the basic moiety was sterically constrained as in the quinuclidine and tropane moieties. Structural analyses of 7a,g were performed by determining their X-ray crystal structures and by molecular modeling (SYBYL). A relatively limited number of minimum energy conformers was found for both compounds. They were characterized by the cis folded conformation of the ethyl chain and by the orientation of the lone pair of the nitrogen atom pointing out of the molecule as seen in conformationally-constrained benzamides such as zacopride and renzapride.

Compounds bearing a lipophilic ester group on ring C were considerably active, but a surprising tolerance of the vanilloid receptor toward the location and the orientation of this ester group was disclosed. Unexpectedly, these ligands could also diminish, to a variable degree, the positive cooperativity which characterizes RTX binding to the vanilloid receptor. Phorbol 12-phenylacetate 13-acetate 20-homovanillate (PPAHV, 6a), a compound which abolished binding cooperativity, was further tested in a variety of in vivo assay used to characterize vanilloid-like activity. PPAHV showed only a marginal pungency and failed to induce a measurable hypothermia response at doses (up to 200 mg/kg) at which it effectively desensitized against neurogenic inflammation.

Consequently, we identified 2-(3-chloro-4-methoxy-phenyl)-5,5-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivative 54 as a highly selective PDE4B inhibitor, which had potent hPDE4B inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 3.0 nM and 433-fold PDE4B selectivity over PDE4D.","Identification of the 5,5-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives as highly selective PDE4B inhibitors.","2-(4-((2-(3-chloro-4-methoxyphenyl)-5,5-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano(3,2-d)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-fluorophenyl)acetic acid| Cyclic S-Oxides| Enzyme Inhibitors| Phenylacetates| Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors",10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.076,04,27,899,,1464-3405,3,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,"Binding Sites| Cyclic S-Oxides| Enzyme Inhibitors| Humans| Inhibitory Concentration 50| Models, Molecular| Molecular Structure| Phenylacetates| Phosphodiesterase 4 Inhibitors",chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology,11,01,24412069,Journal Article,893,24,2014,2014,,,,,"Identification of the 5,5-dioxo-7,8-dihydro-6H-thiopyrano[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives as highly selective PDE4B inhibitors",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.076,,"{""MAG"": ""2038493721"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.076"", ""CorpusId"": 26355315, ""PubMed"": ""24412069""}",24412069,JournalArticle,fe34b7215d59784dc5cadfd9d19164d622ea446d,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

The endogenous tryptamine-based agonist serotonin (5-HT; 1) and the benzenesulfonyl-containing tryptamine-derived 5-HT6 receptor antagonist MS-245 (4a) were automatically docked with each of the 100 receptor models using a genetic algorithm approach. Similar studies were conducted with the more selective 5-HT6 receptor agonist EMDT (5) and optical isomers of EMDT-related analog 8, as well as with optical isomers of MS-245 (4a)-related and benzenesulfonyl-containing pyrrolidine 6 and aminotetralin 7. Although associated with the same general aromatic/hydrophobic binding cluster, 5-HT (1) and MS-245 (4a) were found to preferentially bind with distinct receptor conformations, and did so with different binding orientations (i.e., poses). A 5-HT pose/model was found to be common to EMDT (5) and its analogs, whereas that identified for MS-245 (4a) was found common to benzenesulfonyl-containing compounds. Specific amino acid residues were identified that can participate in binding, and evaluation of a sulfenamide analog of MS-245 indicates for the first time that the presence of the sulfonyl oxygen atoms enhances receptor affinity. The results indicate that the presence or absence of an N1-benzenesulfonyl group is a major determinant of the manner in which tryptamine-related agents bind at 5-HT6 serotonin receptors.",Binding of serotonin and N1-benzenesulfonyltryptamine-related analogs at human 5-HT6 serotonin receptors: receptor modeling studies.,"Benzenesulfonates| Ligands| N1-benzenesulfonyl-5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine| Pyrrolidines| Receptors, Serotonin| Serotonin Antagonists| Serotonin Receptor Agonists| Tetrahydronaphthalenes| Tryptamines| serotonin 6 receptor| Serotonin| Rhodopsin",10.1021/jm070910s,05,20,611,,0022-2623,3,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Algorithms| Animals| Benzenesulfonates| Cattle| Humans| Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions| Ligands| Models, Molecular| Mutagenesis, Site-Directed| Protein Conformation| Pyrrolidines| Receptors, Serotonin| Rhodopsin| Serotonin| Serotonin Antagonists| Serotonin Receptor Agonists| Stereoisomerism| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tetrahydronaphthalenes| Tryptamines",chemistry| chemistry| chemistry| genetics| chemistry| analogs & derivatives| chemistry| chemistry| chemistry| chemistry| chemistry,05,10,18201064,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",603,51,2008,2021,,,,,Binding of Serotonin and N<sub>1</sub>-Benzenesulfonyltryptamine-Related Analogs at Human 5-HT<sub>6</sub> Serotonin Receptors: Receptor Modeling Studies,journal-article,10.1021/jm070910s,,"{""MAG"": ""1993426610"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/jm070910s"", ""CorpusId"": 207224892, ""PubMed"": ""18201064""}",18201064,JournalArticle,468820521ddf0d3904993f1a99a42553f77a8568,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

In contrast, dissociation of 20d from the phosphorylated enzyme was very fast (half-life <5min). A fluorescent tracer based displacement assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis confirmed the slow dissociation of 20d from only non-phosphorylated VEGFR2. Thus, activity based and binding kinetic analyses both supported slow dissociation of 20d from only non-phosphorylated VEGFR2. Additionally SPR analysis revealed that association rates were rapid and nearly identical for these two phosphorylation forms of VEGFR2. From these results, the preferential effect of 20d on non-phosphorylated VEGFR2 is dominated by its slow dissociation from the enzyme and this characteristically long residence time may increase its potency in vivo.

Compound 15 (3-(4-aminophenyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione) proved unexpectedly difficult to prepare following standard methods and was only moderately inhibitory toward aromatase (IC50 = 20 microM). Compound 16 (3-(4-aminophenyl)-3-ethyl-1-methylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione) was weakly inhibitory toward testosterone aromatization and totally inactive toward androstenedione aromatization. These compounds were either weak or ineffective inhibitors of the CSCC enzyme systems, while 1 gave Ki values toward aromatase and CSCC enzymes of 0.68 and 14 microM, respectively. The unsubstituted phenylpyrrolidinediones were inactive in either system, and the 4-nitrophenyl derivatives exhibited weak, nonselective inhibition, indicating the importance of the primary amine moiety for potent inhibition of aromatase activity.","Synthesis and biochemical evaluation of analogues of aminoglutethimide based on phenylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione.",Aromatase Inhibitors| Aminoglutethimide| Testosterone| Oxidoreductases| Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme,,14,09,523,,0022-2623,4,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Aminoglutethimide| Animals| Aromatase Inhibitors| Cattle| Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme| Humans| Oxidoreductases| Structure-Activity Relationship| Testosterone,analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism,05,07,3754286,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",520,29,1986,2019,,,,,"Synthesis and biochemical evaluation of analogs of aminoglutethimide based on phenylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione",journal-article,10.1021/JM00154A016,,"{""MAG"": ""2952646212"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM00154A016"", ""CorpusId"": 22625547, ""PubMed"": ""3754286""}",3754286,JournalArticle,9fbefffa2c630c8295313f0b9fc744a044f6e627,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

In the 1-naphthamide series, the most potent D(4.2) ligand (7) possesses a phenylpropyl moiety while its affinity for 5-HT(2A) receptors is strongly reduced. All compounds with significant affinity for D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were antagonists.","Synthesis and in vitro binding studies of substituted piperidine naphthamides.

Compound 16 not only failed to induce catalepsy in the rat but was quite effective in reversing the cataleptic effect of neuroleptic agents, thus indicating a low propensity for causing extrapyramidal side effects. In comparison to reference antipsychotic agents, 16 appeared to be less sedating and was relatively weaker in causing muscle incoordination. The compound was essentially inactive in binding to dopamine D2 receptors and its chronic administration to rats did not result in dopamine receptor supersensitivity. It exhibited modest to weak affinity for 5-HT1A and alpha 1 receptors but was found to be a fairly potent ligand for sigma binding sites (IC50 vs (+)-[3H]-3-PPP = 112 nM). Although the resolved enantiomers of racemic 16 did not show dramatic differences from racemate or from each other in most tests, the R(+) enantiomer was up to 11-fold more potent than its antipode in binding to sigma sites.

Fourteen novel benzonaphthyridines have been synthesized through synthetic sequences involving as the key step a multicomponent Povarov reaction between an aldehyde, an aniline and an enamine or an enamide as the activated alkene. The novel compounds have been tested against Electrophorus electricus AChE (EeAChE), human recombinant AChE (hAChE), and human serum butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE), and their brain penetration has been assessed using the PAMPA-BBB assay. Also, the mechanism of AChE inhibition of the most potent compounds has been thoroughly studied by kinetic studies, a propidium displacement assay, and molecular modelling. We have found that a seemingly small structural change such as a double O → NH bioisosteric replacement from the hit 1 to 16a results in a dramatic increase of EeAChE and hAChE inhibitory activities (>217- and >154-fold, respectively), and in a notable increase in hBChE inhibitory activity (>11-fold), as well. An optimized binding at the PAS besides additional interactions with AChE midgorge residues seem to account for the high hAChE inhibitory potency of 16a (IC50 = 65 nM), which emerges as an interesting anti-Alzheimer lead compound with potent dual AChE and BChE inhibitory activities.","1,2,3,4-Tetrahydrobenzo[h][1,6]naphthyridines as a new family of potent peripheral-to-midgorge-site inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase: synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and mechanistic studies.","Cholinesterase Inhibitors| Membranes, Artificial| Naphthyridines| Acetylcholinesterase| Butyrylcholinesterase",10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.12.008,07,16,152,,1768-3254,0,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Acetylcholinesterase| Animals| Binding Sites| Blood-Brain Barrier| Butyrylcholinesterase| Cholinesterase Inhibitors| Drug Design| Electrophorus| Humans| Membranes, Artificial| Models, Biological| Molecular Docking Simulation| Molecular Dynamics Simulation| Molecular Structure| Naphthyridines| Permeability| Protein Binding",blood| chemistry| genetics| metabolism| drug effects| enzymology| chemistry| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry,10,11,24389509,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",141,73,2014,2017,,,,,"1,2,3,4-Tetrahydrobenzo[h][1,6]naphthyridines as a new family of potent peripheral-to-midgorge-site inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase: Synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and mechanistic studies",journal-article,10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.12.008,,"{""MAG"": ""2096657589"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.ejmech.2013.12.008"", ""CorpusId"": 262352088, ""PubMed"": ""24389509""}",24389509,JournalArticle,0674f1046637f99d0694bba308107ded6373e977,European journal of medicinal chemistry

The synthesis relies on the key multicomponent split-Ugi reaction, assessing its great potential in generating chemical diversity around the piperazine core. With the aim of evaluating the effect of such diversity on the dopamine receptor affinity, a small library of compounds was prepared, applying post-Ugi transformations. Ligand stimulated binding assays indicated that some compounds show a significant affinity, with K i values up to 53 nM for the D2 receptor.

Most triazoles with open-chain sulfonamide showed significant aromatase inhibitory activity (IC50=1.3-9.4μM). Interestingly, the meta analog of triazole-benzene-sulfonamide (34) bearing 6,7-dimethoxy substituents on the isoquinoline ring displayed the most potent aromatase inhibitory activity (IC50=0.2μM) without affecting normal cell. Molecular docking of these triazoles against aromatase revealed that the compounds could snugly occupy the active site of the enzyme through hydrophobic, π-π stacking, and hydrogen bonding interactions. The potent compound 34 was able to form hydrogen bonds with Met374 and Ser478 which were suggested to be the essential residues for the promising inhibition.

The kinase, CSBP, appears to be involved in a signaling cascade initiated by a number of inflammatory stimuli and leading to the biosynthesis of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF. Two related imidazole classes (B and C) had previously been reported to bind to CSBP and to inhibit LPS-stimulated human monocyte IL-1 and TNF production. The members of the earlier series exhibited varying degrees of potency as inhibitors of the enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism, PGHS-1 and 5-LO. Several of the more potent CSBP ligands and TNF biosynthesis inhibitors among the present series of N-1-alkylated imidazoles (A) were tested as inhibitors of PGHS-1 and 5-LO and were found to be weak to inactive as inhibitors of these enzymes.

The affinity and selectivity of these isoquinolines for D1 receptors was determined by three biochemical endpoints in membrane homogenates prepared from rat corpus striatum: the potency to complete for [3H]SCH23390 binding sites; the potency to compete for [3H]spiperone (a D2 receptor ligand) binding sites; and effects on dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. Competitive binding measurements at D1 sites showed SCH23390 to possess the highest affinity, followed by 1-phenyl greater than 1-benzyl greater than 4-phenyl for the isoquinolines. These results were highly correlated with the ability of the test compounds to antagonize dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase (r = 0.98).

All the analogs were evaluated for displacement of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding at the dopamine transporter and for inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake in rat caudate putamen. Compounds were observed to monophasically displace [3H]WIN 35,428 binding to the dopamine transporter with affinities of 21.6-1836 nM (Ki). Generally, meta-substituted compounds were more potent than benztropine and equipotent to or slightly less potent than their previously reported para-substituted homologs in inhibiting [3H]WIN 35,428 binding. However, these same meta-substituted analogs were typically less potent than the 4'-substituted analogs in inhibiting [3H]dopamine uptake. Ortho-substituted analogs were generally less potent in both binding and inhibition of uptake at the dopamine transporter than either benztropine or other aryl-substituted homologs. The analogs were also tested for binding at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters as well as muscarinic m1 receptors. None of the compounds in the present study bound with high affinity to either the norepinephrine or serotonin transporters, but all bound to muscarinic m1 receptors with high affinity (K1 = 0.41-2.52 nM).

The compounds were evaluated as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFR) from Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), rat liver (RL), and Lactobacillus casei (L. casei); as inhibitors of T. gondii and P. carinii cell growth in culture; and as antitumor agents. The compounds were prepared by modifications of procedures for classical 5-deaza folates. 2,4-Diamino-5-methyl-6-[(3',4',5'-trimethoxy-N- methylanilino)methyl]pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (5a) exhibited high potency as well as selectivity (compared to RL DHFR) for P. carinii and T. gondii DHFR. Compound 5a is one of the most potent and selective nonclassical folate inhibitors of T. gondii DHFR known. The N-10 formyl analogue 2,4-diamino-5-methyl-6-[(N-formyl-3',4',5'-trimethoxyanilino) methyl]pyrido-[2,3-d]pyrimidine (6a) had decreased potency, but it maintained high selectivity for T. gondii DHFR. The corresponding chloro-substituted analogues maintained potency or had decreased potency; N-10 substitution did not increase potency or selectivity to the extent observed in the 3',4',5'-trimethoxy series.

The sulfones, however, were the most potent series of analogues, a number having activity against HIV-1 in the nanomolar range.

The compounds were obtained by various synthetic routes from 1-amino-3-(2-pyridinyl)isoquinoline. The affinity was determined in radioligand binding assays for rat brain A1 and A2A receptors and for the cloned human A3 receptor. A structure-activity relationship analysis indicated that a phenyl group when coupled by a spacer allowing conjugation on position 1 of the isoquinoline ring increased the adenosine A3 receptor affinity. In contrast, such a phenyl group directly bound to position 1 of the isoquinoline ring decreased affinity. Since the combination of a phenyl group together with a spacer raised adenosine A3 receptor affinity, various spacers were investigated. VUF8501 (N-[3-(2-pyridinyl)isoquinolin-1-yl]benzamidine (15) showed an affinity at the human adenosine A3 receptor of 740 nM. Substituent effects on the phenyl group were investigated by in vitro evaluation of a series of substituted benzamidines.

The ability of some of these compounds to inhibit the electrically stimulated twitch of the guinea pig vas deferens indicated that the compounds were M1 agonists. M1 agonist activity was related to the length of the side chain attached to the pyrazine ring, with maximal activity being obtained with the hexyloxy side chain. The (hexyloxy)pyrazine 3f lacked M2 agonist activity as it failed to affect the guinea pig atria and was also relatively devoid of M3 agonist activity as determined by its lack of tremorogenic and sialogogic effects in mice. A comparison of the M1 agonist efficacy of these pyrazines and related 1,2,5-thiadiazoles and 1,2,5-oxadiazoles suggested that M1 efficacy was related to the magnitude of electrostatic potential located over the nitrogens of the respective heterocycles. The heteroatom directly attached to the 3 position of the pyrazine or 1,2,5-thiadiazole heterocycle markedly influenced the M1 efficacy of the compounds by determining the energetically favorably conformers for rotation about the bond connecting the tetrahydropyridyl ring and the heterocycle.

The compounds did not inhibit AChE; the most active compounds inhibited BChE and CaE with IC50 values of 0.22-2.3μM. Pyridine-containing compounds were more selective toward BChE; compounds with the para-OMe substituent in one of the two dibenzyl fragments were more selective toward CaE. Iodinated derivatives were more effective BChE inhibitors than brominated ones, while there was no influence of halogen type on CaE inhibition. Inhibition kinetics for the 9 most active compounds indicated non-competitive inhibition of CaE and varied mechanisms (competitive, non-competitive, or mixed-type) for inhibition of BChE. Docking simulations predicted key binding interactions of compounds with BChE and CaE and revealed that the best docked positions in BChE were at the bottom of the gorge in close proximity to the catalytic residues in the active site. In contrast, the best binding positions for CaE were clustered rather far from the active site at the top of the gorge. Thus, the docking results provided insight into differences in kinetic mechanisms and inhibitor activities of the tested compounds. A cytotoxicity test using the MTT assay showed that within solubility limits (<30μM), none of the tested compounds significantly affected viability of human fetal mesenchymal stem cells. The results indicate that a new series of N,N-disubstituted 2-aminothiazolines could serve as BChE and CaE inhibitors for potential medicinal applications.","Synthesis, molecular docking and biological evaluation of N,N-disubstituted 2-aminothiazolines as a new class of butyrylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase inhibitors.",Cholinesterase Inhibitors| Enzyme Inhibitors| Thiazoles| 2-aminothiazoline| Carboxylesterase| Acetylcholinesterase| Butyrylcholinesterase,10.1016/j.bmc.2016.01.031,31,16,1062,,1464-3391,5,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,Acetylcholinesterase| Animals| Butyrylcholinesterase| Carboxylesterase| Cholinesterase Inhibitors| Enzyme Inhibitors| Horses| Humans| Molecular Docking Simulation| Swine| Thiazoles,metabolism| metabolism| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| pharmacology,10,11,26827140,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1050,24,2016,2017,,,,,"Synthesis, molecular docking and biological evaluation of N,N-disubstituted 2-aminothiazolines as a new class of butyrylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase inhibitors",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmc.2016.01.031,,"{""MAG"": ""2280898644"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmc.2016.01.031"", ""CorpusId"": 25812419, ""PubMed"": ""26827140""}",26827140,JournalArticle,17a30e643e2c0a75d0e19786426916dd708b8c1e,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry

The 3-aryl-substituted compounds 3e-n were 30-160 times better xanthine oxidase inhibitors than allopurinol using hypoxanthine as substrate and 10-80 times better using xanthine as substrate, as evidenced by a comparison of Ki values. The inhibition by all compounds (3a-n) was totally reversible and of the noncompetitive or mixed type. A study of the pH dependence of xanthine oxidase inhibition by 3a,e,g and allopurinol indicated that the 3-aryl substituents facilitated binding to the enzyme.

Many compounds from this class reduce immobility in Porsolt's behavioral despair model in rats upon acute administration and may therefore have therapeutic potential as novel and rapid acting antidepressant agents. Optimal activity in this test is associated with hydrogen, CF3, or small alkyl groups in the 1-position, with NH2, NH-acetyl, or amines substituted with small alkyl groups in the 4-position, and with hydrogen or 8-halogen substituents in the aromatic ring. Furthermore, many of these 4-amino[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines bind avidly, and in some cases very selectively, to adenosine A1 and A2 receptors. A1 affinity of these compounds was measured by their inhibition of tritiated CHA (N6-cyclohexyladenosine) binding in rat cerebral cortex membranes and A2 affinity by their inhibition of tritiated NECA (5'-(N-ethylcarbamoyl)adenosine) binding to rat striatal homogenate in the presence of cold N6-cyclopentyladenosine. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies show that best A1 affinity is associated with ethyl, CF3, or C2F5 in the 1-position, NH-iPr or NH-cycloalkyl in the 4-position, and with an 8-chloro substituent. Affinity at the A2 receptor is mostly dependent on the presence of an NH2 group in the 4-position and is enhanced by phenyl, CF3, or ethyl in the 1-position. The most selective A1 ligand by a factor of greater than 3000 is 121 (CP-68,247; 8-chloro-4-(cyclohexyl-amino)-1- (trifluoromethyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline) with an IC50 of 28 nM at the A1 receptor. The most potent A2 ligand is 128 (CP-66,713; 4-amino-8-chloro-1- phenyl[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline) with an IC50 of 21 nM at the A2 receptor and a 13-fold selectivity for this receptor. Representatives from this series appear to act as antagonists at both A1 and A2 receptors since they antagonize the inhibiting action of CHA on norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP formation in fat cells and they decrease cAMP accumulation induced by adenosine in limbic forebrain slices. Thus certain members of this 4-amino[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline series are among the most potent and A1 or A2 selective non-xanthine adenosine antagonists known.","4-Amino[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalines.

In the N(6)-cyclopentylamino series, the 5'-substituted derivatives showed a reduced affinity at the bovine A(1)AR compared to the parent compounds; however, the selectivity for A(1) versus A(2A) receptor was retained or increased. The corresponding N(6)-3-(R)-tetrahydrofuranylamino analogues displayed a very low affinity toward the bovine A(1)AR. The 5'-methylthionocarbamoyl derivative of 2'-Me-CCPA showed the best affinity at porcine A(1)AR with a K(i) value of 13 nM. At human AR subtypes tecadenoson derivatives showed 2.3- to 5-fold lower affinity at A(1)AR and very low affinity at the other subtypes (A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) compared to the corresponding N(6)-cyclopentyl analogues. The 5'-carbamoyl and 5'-thionocarbamoyl derivatives of 2'-Me-CCPA 3, 4, 7 and tecadenoson derivative 12 were found to be partial A(1) agonists at the porcine receptor. Docking studies explained the lower affinity of N(6)-3-(R)-tetrahydrofuranyl-substituted compounds at bovine A(1)AR compared to that of N(6)-cyclopentyl analogues, showing that the oxygen of the tetrahydrofuranyl ring establishes unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the CO oxygen of Asn254. The low binding affinity of the 2'-C-methyl-N(6)-3-(R)-tetrahydrofuranyl adenosine analogues at human A(1)AR may be ascribed to the presence of unfavorable interactions between the hydrophilic tetrahydrofuranyl ring and the surrounding hydrophobic residues Leu250 (TM6) and Ile274 (TM7).","5'-Carbamoyl derivatives of 2'-C-methyl-purine nucleosides as selective A1 adenosine receptor agonists: affinity, efficacy, and selectivity for A1 receptor from different species.",Adenosine A1 Receptor Agonists| Carbamates| Purine Nucleosides,,29,18,353,,1464-3391,1,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Adenosine A1 Receptor Agonists| Animals| Carbamates| Cattle| Computer Simulation| Humans| Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions| Models, Molecular| Protein Binding| Purine Nucleosides| Static Electricity| Structure-Activity Relationship| Swine",chemistry| chemistry| pharmacology,01,11,17933541,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",336,16,2008,2010,Missing DOI,,,,,,,"HTTP 429: {""message"": ""Too Many Requests.

The most potent compounds contained various hydroxyalkylamines at the 5 position and possessed low nanomolar IC50 values for CDK2 and CDK5. Preliminary profiling of one of the most active compounds on a panel of 50 protein kinases revealed its high selectivity for CDKs. The compounds arrested cells in S and G2/M phases, and induced apoptosis in various cancer cell lines. Significant dephosphorylation of the C-terminus of RNA polymerase II and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), well-established substrates of CDKs, has been found in treated cells. Cleavage of PARP-1, down-regulation of Mcl-1 and activation of caspases correlated well with CDK inhibition and confirmed apoptosis as the primary type of cell death induced in cancer cells treated with the compounds in vitro.

With simple and small C5 oxazole substituents, each series bearing a biphenylethyl, phenoxyphenethyl, or (phenoxymethyl)phenethyl C2 side chain was found to follow a well-defined linear relationship between -log Ki and Hammett sigmap of a magnitude (rho = 2.7-3.0) that indicates that the substituent electronic effect dominates, confirming its fundamental importance to the series and further establishing its predictive value. Just as significantly, the nature of the C5 oxazole substituent substantially impacts the selectivity of the inhibitors whereas the effect of the C2 acyl chain was more subtle but still significant even in the small series examined. Combination of these independent features, which display generalized trends across a range of inhibitor series, simultaneously improves FAAH potency and selectivity and can provide exquisitely selective and potent FAAH inhibitors.",Optimization of alpha-ketooxazole inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase.,Biphenyl Compounds| Oxazoles| Phenyl Ethers| Recombinant Proteins| Amidohydrolases| fatty-acid amide hydrolase,10.1021/jm701210y,19,29,947,,0022-2623,4,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Amidohydrolases| Animals| Biphenyl Compounds| Humans| Molecular Conformation| Oxazoles| Phenyl Ethers| Rats| Recombinant Proteins| Structure-Activity Relationship,antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry,05,05,18247553,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",937,51,2008,2025,,,,,Optimization of α-Ketooxazole Inhibitors of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase,journal-article,10.1021/jm701210y,,"{""MAG"": ""2010359051"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/jm701210y"", ""CorpusId"": 39833982, ""PubMed"": ""18247553""}",18247553,JournalArticle,20efd4ceb5b9b7ae77b7371b63e8e7a361f8764b,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Finally, the compounds were evaluated for their ability to act as topoisomerase II poisons by measuring the topoisomerase IIalpha-mediated double strand cleavage of DNA.

Compounds 4-16 were evaluated for their affinities in opioid receptor binding assays in rat or guinea pig brain membranes and for their opioid antagonist and agonist activities in vitro on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. All of the compounds displayed delta selectivity in binding to the delta, mu, and kappa opioid receptors. The binding potencies of most of the compounds at the delta, mu, and kappa sites, however, were lower than that of 1. Among positional isomers, the 7'-substituted compounds in general had higher affinities than 6'-, 5'-, or 4'-substituted analogues, indicating that bulky groups are tolerated better at the 7'-position than at other positions. The affinity of the compounds were also determined at putative subtypes of the delta and kappa receptors: deltacx-1 (mu-like), deltacx-2 (delta-like), and the kappa2b site in an attempt to identify subtype selective agents. Although none were identified, the data revealed a different rank-order of potency beteween mu vs deltacx-1, deltacx-2 vs delta, and the kappa2b vs mu, delta, and kappa1. The antagonist potencies of the compounds in the MVD were in agreement with their binding affinities at the delta site in rat brain membrane. The most potent member of the series, the 7'-phenoxy compound 14, binds to the delta site with a Ki of 0.71 nM, shows >40-fold delta over mu and delta over kappa binding selectivity, and exhibits delta receptor antagonist potency in the MVD with a Ke of 0.25 nM, properties which are comparable to the delta receptor affinity and antagonist potency of naltrindole (Ki = 0.29 nM, Ke = 0. 49 nM). Interestingly, many members of the series were found to possess significant partial to full agonist activities in the MVD (6, 9, 10, 13, 16) or GPI (6, 11, 14, 15). Among the compounds studied, the highest agonist activity in the MVD was displayed by 16 (IC50 = 220 nM), and the highest agonist activity in the GPI was displayed by 14 (IC50 = 450 nM). The overall affinity and activity profile of compound 14 is, therefore, that of a nonpeptide ligand possessing mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist properties. Recently there has been considerable interest in such compounds possessing mu agonist/delta antagonist activities because of their potential therapeutic usefulness as analgesics with low propensity to produce tolerance and dependence side effects. The results of the present study suggest that morphinan derivatives related to 16 and 14 may provide useful leads for the development of potent nonpeptide ligands possessing delta agonist or mixed delta antagonist/mu agonist activities.","Synthesis, opioid receptor binding, and bioassay of naltrindole analogues substituted in the indolic benzene moiety.","17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-6,7-didehydro--13,14-dihydroxy-5'-(2-(2-pyridinyl)ethenyl)indolo(2',3'-6,7)morphinan| 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-13,14-dihydroxy-7'-phenoxyindolo(2',3'-6,7)morphinan| Indoles| Ligands| Morphinans| Narcotic Antagonists| Receptors, Opioid| Receptors, Opioid, delta| Receptors, Opioid, kappa| Receptors, Opioid, mu| Naltrexone| naltrindole",,03,24,2881,,0022-2623,15,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Brain| Guinea Pigs| Ileum| Indoles| Ligands| Male| Mice| Morphinans| Muscle Contraction| Muscle, Smooth| Naltrexone| Narcotic Antagonists| Rats| Receptors, Opioid| Receptors, Opioid, delta| Receptors, Opioid, kappa| Receptors, Opioid, mu| Structure-Activity Relationship| Vas Deferens",drug effects| metabolism| drug effects| physiology| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| drug effects| drug effects| physiology| analogs & derivatives| metabolism| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| metabolism| pharmacology| agonists| metabolism| agonists| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| agonists| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| agonists| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| drug effects| physiology,08,11,9667975,"Comparative Study| Journal Article| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",2872,41,1998,2016,,,,,"Synthesis, Opioid Receptor Binding, and Bioassay of Naltrindole Analogues Substituted in the Indolic Benzene Moiety",journal-article,10.1021/JM980083I,,"{""MAG"": ""2103077095"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM980083I"", ""CorpusId"": 25795181, ""PubMed"": ""9667975""}",9667975,JournalArticle; Study,5d3b8201001c24b7f2b86245a83afb0da3f97dfe,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

All the steroids inhibited the enzyme in a competitive manner with Ki's ranging from 0.058 to 45 microM. The inhibitory activities of 17-oxo compounds were much more potent than those of the corresponding 17 beta-alcohols in each series. Steroids having an oxygen function (hydroxy or carbonyl) at C-19 were less potent inhibitors than the corresponding parent compounds having a 19-methyl group. 3,5-Dien-7-one 24 and its 19-hydroxy and 19-oxo derivatives (12 and 13) as well as 19-oxo-5-en-7-one 3 caused a time-dependent inactivation of aromatase only in the presence of NADPH in which the kinact values of 19-als 3 and 13 (0.143 and 0.189 min-1, respectively) were larger than those of the corresponding 19-methyl (23 and 24) and 19-hydroxy (1 and 12) steroids, respectively. 19-Nor-5-en-7-one 4 but not its 3,5-diene derivative 14 also inactivated the enzyme in a time-dependent manner.

The inactivations were prevented by the substrate androstenedione, and no significant effects of L-cysteine on the inactivations were observed in each case.

The valproyl derivative of acetazolamide (5-valproylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, 6M) was one of the best hCA I and hCA II inhibitor in the series and exhibited very strong anticonvulsant properties in an MES test in mice. In consequence, other 1,3,4-thiadiazolesulfonamide derivatives possessing potent CA inhibitory properties and substituted with different alkyl/arylcarboxamido/sulfonamido/ureido moieties in the 5 position have been investigated for their anticonvulsant effects in the same animal model. It was observed that some lipophilic derivatives, such as 5-benzoylamido-, 5-toluenesulfonylamido-, 5-adamantylcarboxamido-, and 5-pivaloylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, show promising in vivo anticonvulsant properties and that these compounds may be considered as interesting leads for developing anticonvulsant or selective cerebrovasodilator drugs.",Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: anticonvulsant sulfonamides incorporating valproyl and other lipophilic moieties.,"5-valproylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide| Anticonvulsants| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Sulfonamides| Topiramate| Fructose| Carbonic Anhydrase I| Carbonic Anhydrase II| Carbonic Anhydrase IV| Acetazolamide",,07,10,320,,0022-2623,2,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Acetazolamide| Animals| Anticonvulsants| Carbonic Anhydrase I| Carbonic Anhydrase II| Carbonic Anhydrase IV| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Electroshock| Fructose| Humans| Male| Mice| Models, Molecular| Seizures| Structure-Activity Relationship| Sulfonamides| Topiramate",analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| antagonists & inhibitors| antagonists & inhibitors| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| analogs & derivatives| pharmacology| drug therapy| etiology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,02,07,11784136,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",312,45,2002,2019,,,,,Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors:  Anticonvulsant Sulfonamides Incorporating Valproyl and Other Lipophilic Moieties,journal-article,10.1021/JM0109199,,"{""MAG"": ""2065461165"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM0109199"", ""CorpusId"": 25786171, ""PubMed"": ""11784136""}",11784136,JournalArticle,4bdab5b700f65892a23fb211a650770cdece5b38,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry
