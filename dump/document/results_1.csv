VMAT2 is a target for the development of treatments for methamphetamine abuse. Structural modification of lobeline affords the defunctionalized analogues meso-transdiene (MTD) and lobelane, which have high potency and selectivity for VMAT2. To establish the structure-activity relationships within this novel class of VMAT2 ligands, specific stereochemical forms of MTD, lobelane, and other structurally related analogues have been synthesized. These compounds have been evaluated for inhibition of [(3)H]nicotine ([(3)H]NIC) binding (alpha4beta2 nAChR), [(3)H]methyllycaconitine ([(3)H]MLA) binding (alpha7 nAChR), and [(3)H]dihydrotetrabenazine ([(3)H]DTBZ) binding (VMAT2). Generally, all of these analogues had lower affinities at alpha4beta2 and alpha7 nAChRs compared to lobeline, thereby increasing selectivity for VMAT2. The following structural modifications resulted in only modest changes in affinity for VMAT2, affording analogues that were less potent than the lead compound, lobelane: (1) altering the stereochemistry at the C-2 and C-6 positions of the piperidino ring, (2) varying unsaturation in the piperidino C-2 and C-6 substituents, (3) introducing unsaturation into the piperidine ring, (4) ring-opening or eliminating the piperidine ring, and (5) removing the piperidino N-methyl group. Furthermore, incorporating a quaternary ammonium group into defunctionalized lobeline molecules in the cis-series resulted in significant loss of affinity for VMAT2, whereas only a modest change in affinity was obtained in the trans-series. The most potent (K(i) = 630 nM) and VMAT2-selective compound evaluated was the N-methyl-2,6-cis-bis(naphthaleneethyl)piperidine analogue (1-NAP-lobelane), in which the phenyl groups of lobelane were replaced with 1-naphthyl moieties. Thus, initial structure-activity relationship studies reveal that the most promising structural changes to the lobeline molecule that lead to enhancement of VMAT2 affinity and selectivity are defunctionalization, affording lobelane and MTD, and replacement of the phenyl rings of lobelane with other aromatic moieties that have a pi-extended structure.",Defunctionalized lobeline analogues: structure-activity of novel ligands for the vesicular monoamine transporter.,"Ligands| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Slc18a2 protein, rat| Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins| Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins| Lobeline",,14,13,5560,,0022-2623,17,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Animals| Brain| In Vitro Techniques| Ligands| Lobeline| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Radioligand Assay| Rats| Stereoisomerism| Structure-Activity Relationship| Synaptic Vesicles| Vesicular Biogenic Amine Transport Proteins| Vesicular Monoamine Transport Proteins,metabolism| analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| metabolism| metabolism| metabolism,10,11,16107155,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",5551,48,2005,2018,,,,,Defunctionalized Lobeline Analogues:  Structure−Activity of Novel Ligands for the Vesicular Monoamine Transporter,journal-article,10.1021/JM0501228,,"{""MAG"": ""2084276613"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM0501228"", ""CorpusId"": 22903313, ""PubMed"": ""16107155""}",16107155,JournalArticle,5eec50f6f245b764138269e9d32a535a56e476ca,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Therefore, several analogues (4-13) were synthesized by esterification and carbamoylation of tyrosol using diverse phenolic naturally occurring in olive and heterocyclic acids as elenolic acid bioisosteres to assess the effect of replacing the acid moiety of (-)-oleocanthal. Their c-MET inhibitory activity as well as their antiproliferative, antimigratory, and anti-invasive activities against the highly metastatic human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 has been assessed.

To increase the lipophilicity of 7 by addition of a nonpolar substituent to the sulfonamide nitrogen, a small library of (+/-)-3-fluoromethyl-7-(N-substituted aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines was synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of PNMT and for affinity at the alpha2-adrenoceptor. In addition, this library probed the PNMT active site surrounding the sulfonamide nitrogen of 7. Bulky substituents on the sulfonamide nitrogen are disfavored at the PNMT active site more so than at the alpha2-adrenoceptor (thus reducing selectivity). On the other hand, alkyl chains on the sulfonamide nitrogen that contain an electron dense atom, such as a fluorine, are favored in the PNMT active site and possess little alpha2-adrenoceptor affinity, thereby conferring good selectivity (>500). Several members of the library (8, 14, 17, and 18) have excellent PNMT inhibitory potency and selectivity and are predicted, on the basis of their ClogP value (>0.5), to penetrate the BBB to a significant extent.

These four stereoisomers were prepared from optically active intermediates of known absolute configuration by procedures which had no effect on the configurations of the piperidine 3- and 4-carbons. The configuration of the phenylethyl 2-carbon in the final products was determined by X-ray analysis of (2S,3S,4R)-1d. A 1H NMR comparison of the final products to ohmefentanyl established that the racemic pair previously known as ohmefentanyl was a mixture of (2S,3R,4S)-1a and (2R,3S,4R)-1c. The individual activities of 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d were evaluated in a variety of binding and pharmacological assays. The binding data revealed that isomers 1b and 1c had the highest affinity and selectivity for the mu site labeled with [3H]DAMGO. In contrast, the four isomers displaced [3H]etorphine in the order 1a approximately 1b > 1c approximately 1d. Evaluation of the four isomers on the mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparation revealed a potency order of 1a > 1b > 1c > 1d with concentrations of 1a and 1b in the femtomolar range causing inhibition. Experiments using the antagonists naltrexone (mu), ICI 174864 (delta), and norbinaltorphimine (kappa) demonstrated that the effects of 1a were mediated largely by the mu receptor while both delta and kappa agonist effects contributed to the actions of 1b and 1c. Isomer 1d acted as a weak mu antagonist in the MVD preparation. The same potency order was observed in a mouse analgesic assay and a rhesus monkey single dose suppression study. From the latter study the potency of 1a was estimated to be 20,000-50,000 times that of morphine, making this isomer one of the most potent opiates known. In the rhesus monkey study, isomer 1d failed to substitute for morphine and seemed to exacerbate withdrawal at doses of 0.6, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg. On the basis of the mouse data, isomer 1a was 21,000 times more potent than 1d, whereas isomers 1b and 1c were similar in their opiate activity in vivo.

Many of these analogues showed high SERT binding affinities (Ki=1-40 nM) and selectivities over both NET and DAT. Selected enantiomeric pairs of analogues were synthesized and both retained enantioselectivity as with S- and R-1, wherein S>R at the SERT. In addition, the enantiomeric pairs of 1 and 5 were tested for binding at the homologous bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), wherein low affinities and the absence of enantioselectivity suggested distinctive binding sites for these compounds at SERT as compared to LeuT.

A number of studies have demonstrated EGCG has the possibility for delaying the onset or retarding the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and indicated EGCG possess inhibition of β-secretase activity. We utilized homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay with a substrate Eu-CEVNLDAEFK-Qsy7 to screen β-secretase inhibitor in a cell-free system and AlphaLISA assay in cell system. The results first showed that EGCG had significant inhibition of β-secretase activity with IC(50) value of 7.57 × 10(-7)M in screening assay, but then we found EGCG had significant fluorescence-quenching effect in confirming assay, this indicates EGCG has the false positive β-secretase inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the followed AlphaLISA assay based on cell showed EGCG did not reduce the β-amyloid 1-40 secretion in HuAPPswe/HuBACE1 Chinese hamster ovary cell without affecting cell viability. Therefore our findings indicate EGCG do not inhibit β-secretase cleavage activity. Overall this study illustrates that EGCG is not a β-secretase inhibitor based on the compelling data.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the ""message-address"" concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

In previous studies, we reported that certain (1R)-3 beta-(substituted phenyl)nortropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl esters (2a) exhibited high affinity and reasonable selectivity for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). The major structural differences between 2a and (3S,4R)-3 are that 2a possesses a different absolute stereochemistry and has an ethylene bridge not present in 3. In addition, 2a possesses a carbomethoxy substituent adjacent to the aryl ring, whereas (3S,4R)-3 contains a [3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenoxy]methyl group. In this study, we present the synthesis and biological evaluations of six of the possible eight isomers of 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[[3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenoxy]methyl]nortropane+ ++ (4). The data for inhibition of [3H]paroxetine binding show that (1R)-2 beta, 3 alpha-4c, which has the same stereochemistry as paroxetine, has the highest affinity at the 5-HTT. Strikingly, the most potent compounds for inhibition of [3H]WIN-35,428 binding were not the (1R)-2 beta, 3 beta-isomers but rather (1R)-2 beta, 3 alpha-4c and (1S)-2 beta, 3 alpha-4f. Conformational analyses show that these isomers exist in a flattened boat conformation with pseudoequatorial substituents. Thus, the binding data show that this conformation is recognized by the DAT-associated binding site and also suggest that this conformation of paroxetine is recognized by the 5-HTT-associated binding site.",Synthesis and ligand binding of tropane ring analogues of paroxetine.,"Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors| Ligands| Receptors, Serotonin| Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors| Tropanes| Paroxetine| (1R-(exo,exo))-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-8-methyl-8- azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, methyl ester| Cocaine",,06,07,257,,0022-2623,2,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Binding, Competitive| Cocaine| Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors| Isomerism| Ligands| Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy| Models, Chemical| Models, Molecular| Paroxetine| Receptors, Serotonin| Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tropanes",analogs & derivatives| metabolism| metabolism| analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| metabolism| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism,03,12,9457247,"Journal Article| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",247,41,1998,2022,,,,,Synthesis and Ligand Binding of Tropane Ring Analogues of Paroxetine,journal-article,10.1021/JM970669P,,"{""MAG"": ""1967803181"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM970669P"", ""CorpusId"": 39288475, ""PubMed"": ""9457247""}",9457247,JournalArticle,33e87dec35f6ce54197b8dfeaf203b6e68f7e1e7,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Because inhibition of related enzymes such as 11beta-HSD2 and 17beta-HSDs causes sodium retention and hypertension or interferes with sex steroid hormone metabolism, respectively, highly selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors are required for successful therapy.

We here report the preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR) studies of this novel lead compound. For the new ligands synthesized as NAQ analogues, their binding assay results showed that a longer spacer and a saturated ring system of the side chain were unfavorable for their MOR selectivity over the kappa and delta opioid receptors. In contrast, substitutions with different electronic properties at either 1'- or 4'-position of the isoquinoline ring of the side chain were generally acceptable for reasonable MOR selectivity. The majority of NAQ analogues retained low efficacy at the MOR compared to NAQ in the (35)S-GTP[γS] binding assays while electron-withdrawing groups at 1'-position of the isoquinoline ring induced higher MOR stimulation than electron-donating groups did. In summary, the electronic characteristics of substituents at 1'- or 4'-position of the isoquinoline ring in NAQ seem to be critical and need to be further tuned up to achieve higher MOR selectivity and lower MOR stimulation.","Structure activity relationship studies of 17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14β-dihydroxy-4,5α-epoxy-6α-(isoquinoline-3'-carboxamido)morphinan (NAQ) analogues as potent opioid receptor ligands: preliminary results on the role of electronic characteristics for affinity and function.","17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14beta-dihydroxy-4,5alpha-epoxy-6alpha-(isoquinoline-3'-carboxamido)morphinan| Isoquinolines| Ligands| Morphinans| Receptors, Opioid, mu",10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.07.043,31,20,5048,,1464-3405,18,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,"Drug Design| Electrons| Isoquinolines| Ligands| Molecular Structure| Morphinans| Receptors, Opioid, mu| Structure-Activity Relationship",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism,03,04,23948248,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",5045,23,2014,2024,,,,,"Structure activity relationship studies of 17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14β-dihydroxy-4,5α-epoxy-6α-(isoquinoline-3′-carboxamido)morphinan (NAQ) analogues as potent opioid receptor ligands: Preliminary results on the role of electronic characteristics for affinity and function",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.07.043,,"{""MAG"": ""1977003174"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.07.043"", ""CorpusId"": 206257585, ""PubMed"": ""23948248""}",23948248,JournalArticle,549052d36fe86bbbee7eccb7056377de88a5cc2a,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

As 17β-HSD2 is present in bones and as estradiol and testosterone are able to induce bone formation and repress bone resorption, inhibition of this enzyme could be a new promising approach for the treatment of osteoporosis. Herein, we describe the design, the synthesis and the biological evaluation of 24 new 17β-HSD2 inhibitors in the 5-substituted thiophene-2-carboxamide class. Structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationships have been explored by variation of the sulfur atom position in the central core, exchange of the thiophene by a thiazole, substitution of the amide group with a larger moiety, exchange of the N-methylamide group with bioisosteres like N-methylsulfonamide, N-methylthioamide and ketone, and substitutions at positions 2 and 3 of the thiophene core with alkyl and phenyl groups leading to 2,3,5-trisubstituted thiophene derivatives.

Binding affinities of these new compounds at A(1) and A(2A) receptors in rat brain membranes and at A(3) in rat testis membranes were determined and compared. It was found that the 1'-C-methyl modification in adenosine resulted in a decrease of affinity, particularly at A(1) and A(2A) receptors. When this modification was combined with N(6) substitutions with groups that induce high potency and selectivity at A(1) receptors, the high affinity was in part restored and the selectivity was increased.

Potency and selectivity can be achieved with sulfonamides derived from a variety of amines and is further enhanced by the incorporation of sulfonamides derived from amino acids. The binding mode of these 1-isoquinolinylguanidines has been investigated by X-ray cocrystallization studies. uPA inhibitor 26 was selected for further evaluation based on its excellent enzyme potency (Ki 10 nM) and selectivity profile (4000-fold versus tPA and 2700-fold versus plasmin). In vitro, compound 26 is able to inhibit exogenous uPA in human chronic wound fluid (IC50=0.89 microM).

Here, we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of 22S-hexyl analog 5 (22S-Hex), which was designed to be a stronger VDR antagonist than 4. Unexpectedly, 5 showed partial agonistic but not antagonistic activity when bound to VDR, indicating that it is not necessarily true that the bulkier the side chain is, the stronger the antagonistic activity will be. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the VDR-ligand-binding domain (VDR-LBD) accommodating compound 5 indicated that the partial agonist activity of 5 is dependent on the mixed population of the agonistic and antagonistic conformations. Binding of compound 5 may not bring the complex into the only antagonistic conformation due to the large conformational change of the VDR-LBD.

In smooth muscle preparations, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the affinity labels 3-6 behaved as kappa agonists in that they were potently antagonized by norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In addition to the high binding affinity and selectivity of the 3-isothiocyanate 3 (DIPPA) to kappa opioid receptors, wash studies have suggested that this involves covalent binding. In the mouse tail-flick assay, the 3- and 4-substituted isomers (3 and 5, respectively) produced long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive effect of the kappa opioid agonist, (+/-)-trans-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]acetamide ((+/-)-U50,488).

The improved kappa-selectivities of 3 and 4 and the different agonist and antagonist potencies of 3 and 5 may be explained respectively by the existence of multiple kappa agonist binding sites and distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites.

Previous in vitro selection for 4'-Ed4T-resistant viral strains revealed M184V and P119S/T165A/M184V mutations on days 26 and 81, respectively; M184V and P119S/T165A/M184V conferred 3- and 130-fold resistance to 4'-Ed4T, respectively. We investigated the relative contributions of these mutations, engineered into the strain NL4-3 background, to drug resistance, RT activity, and viral growth. Viral variants with single RT mutations (P119S or T165A) did not show resistance to 4'-Ed4T; however, M184V and P119S/T165A/M184V conferred three- and fivefold resistance, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type virus. The P119S/M184V and T165A/M184V variants showed about fourfold resistance to 4'-Ed4T. The differences in the growth kinetics of the variants were not more than threefold. The purified RT of mutants with the P119S/M184V and T165A/M184V mutations were inhibited by 4'-Ed4TTP with 8- to 13-fold less efficiency than wild-type RT. M184V may be the primary resistance-associated mutation of 4'-Ed4T, and P119S and T165A are secondary mutations. On the basis of our findings and the results of structural modeling, a virus with a high degree of resistance to 4'-Ed4T (e.g., more than 50-fold resistance) will be difficult to develop. The previously observed 130-fold resistance of the virus with P119S/T165A/M184V to 4'-Ed4T may be partly due to mutations both in the RT sequence and outside the RT sequence.",Impact of novel human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase mutations P119S and T165A on 4'-ethynylthymidine analog resistance profile.,"Anti-HIV Agents| Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors| 2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxy-4'-ethynylthymidine| Stavudine| reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1| HIV Reverse Transcriptase",10.1128/AAC.00686-09,08,29,4646,,1098-6596,11,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,"Anti-HIV Agents| Computer Simulation| Drug Resistance, Viral| HIV Reverse Transcriptase| HIV-1| Humans| Microbial Sensitivity Tests| Mutation| Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors| Stavudine",pharmacology| genetics| drug effects| pharmacology| analogs & derivatives| pharmacology,02,05,19704131,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",4640,53,2010,2025,,,,,Impact of Novel Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Reverse Transcriptase Mutations P119S and T165A on 4′-Ethynylthymidine Analog Resistance Profile,journal-article,10.1128/AAC.00686-09,,"{""MAG"": ""2137274922"", ""DOI"": ""10.1128/AAC.00686-09"", ""CorpusId"": 322561, ""PubMed"": ""19704131""}",19704131,JournalArticle,498865e2f004da9bccebbd694d548f4b9075acf2,Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy

Exceptionally high levels of combined potency and selectivity as growth inhibitors of T. gondii and as inhibitors of the microbial enzymes relative to the mammalian enzyme were found among the 5-methyl-5-deazapteridines but not for the other heterocyclic types. Thirty of the 34 5-methyl-5-deaza compounds gave growth inhibition IC50 values lower than that of pyrimethamine (0.4 microM) with 14 compounds below 0.1 microM, values that compare favorably with those for piritrexim and trimetrexate (both near 0.02 microM). As inhibitors of T gondii DHFR, all but three of the 34 5-methyl-5-deaza compounds gave IC50 values in the order of magnitude with those of piritrexim (0.017 microM) and trimetrexate (0.010 microM), and 17 compounds of this group gave IC50 values versus P. carinii DHFR similarly comparable with those of piritrexim (0.031 microM) and trimetrexate (0.042 microM). Thirteen of these congeners gave both T. gondii growth inhibition and DHFR inhibition IC50 values of 0.10 microM or less, thus indicating facile penetration of the cell membrane. Eleven of these inhibitors of both T. gondii growth and DHFR have selectivity ratios (IC50 rat liver divided by IC50 T. gondii) of 5 or greater for the parasite DHFR. The highest selectivity ratio of nearly 100 belongs to the 5-methyl-5-deaza compound whose 6-substituent is CH2CH2C6H3(OCH3)2-2,5. This compound is over 10(3)-fold more selective for T. gondii DHFR than bridge homologue piritrexim (selectivity ratio 0.088), a compound now in clinical trials. The candidate with CH2NHC6H3(CH3)2-2,5 in the 6-position gave the highest P. carinii DHFR selectivity ratio of 4.0, which is about 60-fold more selective than trimetrexate (0.071) and 80-fold more selective than piritrexim (0.048) toward this enzyme. The 10 best compounds with respect to potency and selectivity includes six compounds bearing 2,5-disubstituted phenyl groups in the side chain (with little, if any, difference in effects of methyl, methoxy, or ethoxy), two side chains bearing 1-naphthyl groups, and two with 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl groups. Bridge groups represented in the 10 choice compounds are CH2NH, CH2N(CH3), CH2CH2, and CH2S. The high levels of both potency and selectivity among these agents suggest that in vivo studies now underway may lead to agents that could replace trimetrexate and piritrexim in treatment of toxoplasmosis and P. carinii pneumonia.",Lipophilic antifolates as agents against opportunistic infections. 1.

This mutant enzyme is approximately 100-fold more resistant than native enzyme to the classical antifolate methotrexate (MTX), yet shows minimal cross resistance to the nonclassical antifolates piritrexim (PTX) and trimetrexate (TMQ). Although they were much less potent than trimetrexate and piritrexim, the lipophilic 5-substituted analogues were all found to bind approximately 10 times better to the mutant DHFR than to the wild-type enzyme. The potency of the analogue with a classical (p-aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate side chain was similarly diminished in comparison with MTX, but the difference in its binding affinity to the two DHFR species was only 5-fold. Thus, by making subtle structural changes in the antifolate molecule, it may be possible to attack resistance due to mutational alterations in the active site of the target enzyme. Also, to test the hypothesis that DHFR from Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii may have a less sterically restrictive active site than the enzyme from mammalian cells, inhibition assays using several of the lipophilic analogues in the series were carried out against the P. carinii and T. gondii reductases in comparison with the enzyme from rat liver. In contrast to their preferential binding to mutant versus wild-type human DHFR, binding of these analogues to the P. carinii and T. gondii enzymes was weaker than binding to rat enzyme. It thus appears that, if the active site of the DHFR from these parasites is less sterically restrictive than the active site of the mammalian enzyme, this difference cannot be successfully exploited by moving the side chain from the 6-position to the 5-position.","2,4-Diamino-5-substituted-quinazolines as inhibitors of a human dihydrofolate reductase with a site-directed mutation at position 22 and of the dihydrofolate reductases from Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii.","Folic Acid Antagonists| Quinazolines| 2,4-diaminoquinazoline",,04,09,752,,0022-2623,5,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Folic Acid Antagonists| Humans| In Vitro Techniques| Liver| Mutagenesis, Site-Directed| Pneumocystis| Quinazolines| Rats| Structure-Activity Relationship| Toxoplasma",enzymology| enzymology| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| enzymology,04,07,7877140,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",745,38,1995,2019,,,,,"2,4-Diamino-5-substituted-quinazolines as Inhibitors of a Human Dihydrofolate Reductase with a Site-Directed Mutation at Position 22 and of the Dihydrofolate Reductases from Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii",journal-article,10.1021/JM00005A002,,"{""MAG"": ""2016475391"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM00005A002"", ""CorpusId"": 29056157, ""PubMed"": ""7877140""}",7877140,JournalArticle,c762dd86c23cf88dc54f50f74db6ddc1f2c4ddc1,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Binding affinities of these compounds were determined in cells transfected to express human SERT, DAT, and NET using [3H]citalopram, [125I]RTI-55, and [3H]nisoxetine, respectively. Both ZIET and ZBrET displayed high affinity for the SERT (Ki = 0.11 and 0.08 nM, respectively). The affinities of ZIET and ZBrET for the DAT were 200 and 38-fold lower, respectively, than for the SERT.

Biodistribution studies in rats indicated that [123I]ZIET enters the brain readily and accumulates in SERT-rich regions. Blocking studies performed in rats demonstrated that [123I]ZIET was selective and specific for SERT-rich regions (e.g. thalamus, brainstem, and striatum). MicroPET brain imaging studies in monkeys demonstrated that [11C]ZIET and [11C]ZBrET uptakes were selectivity localized in the putamen, midbrain, caudate, thalamus, pons, and medulla. Radioactivity in the regions of high SERT density of monkey brain was displaceable with citalopram except in the putamen and caudate. Radioactivity uptake in these DAT-rich regions was significantly displaceable either by preadministration of citalopram followed by injection of RTI-113 (or vice-versa) or by administration of a mixture of DAT and SERT ligands. In conclusion, the high yield, high specific activity, one-step radiolabeling method, high selectivity and favorable kinetics, and the good results obtained with [123I]ZIET in rats support the candidacy of [11C]ZIET for in vivo visualization and quantification of brain SERT.","Synthesis, radiosynthesis, and biological evaluation of carbon-11 and iodine-123 labeled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-[4'-((Z)-2-haloethenyl)phenyl]tropanes: candidate radioligands for in vivo imaging of the serotonin transporter.","2-carbomethoxy-3-(4'-(2-bromoethenyl)phenyl)tropane| 2-carbomethoxy-3-(4'-(2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)tropane| Carbon Radioisotopes| Carrier Proteins| Iodine Radioisotopes| Ligands| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Nerve Tissue Proteins| SLC6A4 protein, human| Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Slc6a4 protein, rat| Tropanes| Serotonin",,13,21,1135,,0022-2623,5,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Binding, Competitive| Brain| Carbon Radioisotopes| Carrier Proteins| Cell Line| Dogs| Humans| Iodine Radioisotopes| Isotope Labeling| Ligands| Macaca fascicularis| Macaca mulatta| Male| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Nerve Tissue Proteins| Radioligand Assay| Rats| Rats, Sprague-Dawley| Serotonin| Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tomography, Emission-Computed| Tropanes",metabolism| metabolism| metabolism| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology,04,11,14971892,"Journal Article| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",1122,47,2004,2013,,,,,"Synthesis, Radiosynthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Carbon-11 and Iodine-123 Labeled 2β-Carbomethoxy-3β-[4‘-((<i>Z</i>)-2-haloethenyl)phenyl]tropanes:  Candidate Radioligands for in Vivo Imaging of the Serotonin Transporter",journal-article,10.1021/JM030384E,,"{""MAG"": ""1994406190"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM030384E"", ""CorpusId"": 42192224, ""PubMed"": ""14971892""}",14971892,JournalArticle,6a624804cd8e8e9f98995cc3ab6dcac729013ae3,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Substitution of the 2-chloro atom with larger and more hydrophobic substituents, such as iodo and alkynyl groups, tended to increase the A(3)AR selectivity (up to 430-fold) in mouse and preserve it in human. Extended and chemically functionalized alkynyl chains attached at the C2 position of the purine moiety preserved A(3)AR selectivity more effectively than similar chains attached at the 3-position of the N(6)-benzyl group.",Design of (N)-methanocarba adenosine 5'-uronamides as species-independent A3 receptor-selective agonists.,Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists| Alkanes| Nucleosides| Ribose| Adenosine,10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.04.001,15,29,2819,,1464-3405,9,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,"Adenosine| Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists| Alkanes| Animals| Binding Sites| Drug Design| Humans| Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions| Mice| Models, Chemical| Nucleosides| Ribose| Structure-Activity Relationship",analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemistry| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemistry,07,05,18424135,"Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2813,18,2008,2025,,,,,Design of (N)-methanocarba adenosine 5′-uronamides as species-independent A3 receptor-selective agonists,journal-article,10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.04.001,,"{""MAG"": ""2012737741"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmcl.2008.04.001"", ""CorpusId"": 13770247, ""PubMed"": ""18424135""}",18424135,JournalArticle,d7d336d00f3c6e32213ce474c9ae5742ee1e6791,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

PMID not found,,,,,,,,"2-Phenylpyrroles were synthesized as conformationally restricted analogues of the substituted benzamide sultopride and the butyrophenones haloperidol and fluanisone. Dopamine antagonistic activity is maintained if the 2-phenylpyrrole side chain is linked to the pharmacophoric N-ethylpyrrolidine moiety of sultopride or to the 4-substituted piperazine moiety of fluanisone but is lost if the 2-phenylpyrrole is combined with the 4-substituted piperidine moiety of haloperidol. The 2-phenylpyrrole analogue 1 of sultopride is in vitro 0.25 and in vivo 3 times as potent as the parent compound. Its binding to the dopamine D-2 receptors is, in analogy to the substituted benzamides, strongly sodium-dependent. The 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrrole analogue 5 of fluanisone is superior in vitro as well as in vivo to the corresponding benzamide 7 and the butyrophenone fluanisone. The increase in activity is not only due to a higher affinity for the D-2 receptors but also to an enhanced oral absorption (ratio po/ip = 4.5 vs 40 for the benzamide and 60 for fluanisone). Compound 5 is further characterized by a high selectivity for the D-2 receptors, in contrast to the benzamide and butyrophenone analogues (ratio D-2/alpha 1 = 60, 2.0, and 0.3, respectively). The binding to the D-2 receptors has little dependence on sodium. The 2-phenylpyrrole 5 shares with the benzamide 7 a low potential to induce catalepsy, which is in contrast to haloperidol. So, 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]methyl]pyrrole (5) is the prototype of a new class of sodium-independent dopamine D-2 antagonists, which may be particularly useful as potential antipsychotics with a low propensity to induce acute extrapyramidal side effects.",2-Phenylpyrroles as conformationally restricted benzamide analogues.

This compound is more lipophilic than 1 by three log units (log P, octanol/water). Compound 2 was approximately equipotent with 1 in inhibiting Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), 2-fold more potent against P. berghei and N. gonorrhoeae DHFR, and 10 and 25 times better an inhibitor of rat and chicken liver DHFR, respectively. Although the 3,4-dimethoxy analogue 19 was 10-fold less inhibitory to E. coli DHFR than 1, it was 3-4 times more potent on the vertebrate isozymes, whereas the diethyl congener 10 followed 19 in its E. coli DHFR binding but was less active on rat and chicken DHFR.

We previously prepared a benztropine-based photoaffinity label [125I]-(N-[4-(4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl)butyl]-3alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl)methoxy]tropane, [125I]1, that covalently attached to the 1-2 transmembrane spanning region of the dopamine transporter (DAT). This was in contrast to the 4-7 transmembrane spanning region labeled by a cocaine-based photoaffinity label, [125I] 2 (RTI 82). To characterize further these different binding domains, photoaffinity ligands that had the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl substituent extended from the same position on the tropane ring were desirable. Thus, identification of the optimal alkyl linker between this substituent and the tropane nitrogen in the benztropine series was investigated to ultimately prepare the identical N-substituted analogue of 2. In this pursuit, the N-[4-(4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl)propyl] analogue of 3alpha-[bis(4'-fluorophenyl)methoxy]tropane (9a) was synthesized as well as two isothiocyanate analogues that do not require photoactivation (10a,b) for irreversible binding. The synthesis of these target compounds was achieved using a modification of the strategy developed for 1. Evaluation of these compounds for displacing [3H]WIN 35 428 binding at DAT in rat caudate putamen revealed that the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenylbutyl substituent, found in 1, provided optimal binding affinity and was chosen to replace the N-CH3 group on 2. Both the 4'-azido-3'-iodophenyl- and the 4'-isothiocyanatophenylbutyl analogues of 2 (25 and 26, respectively) were synthesized. Both products bound to DAT with comparable potency (IC(50) = 30 nM) to RTI 82 (2). In addition, compound 26 demonstrated wash-resistant displacement of [3H]WIN 35 428 in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with hDAT.

Molecular modeling studies with 3-fluoromethyl-7-(N-alkyl aminosulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, such as 16, suggested that the sulfonamide -NH- could form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Lys57. However, SAR studies and analysis of the crystal structure of human PNMT (hPNMT) in complex with 7 indicated that the sulfonamide oxygens, and not the sulfonamide -NH-, formed favorable interactions with the enzyme. Thus, we hypothesized that replacement of the sulfonamide -NH- with a methylene group could result in compounds that would retain potency at PNMT and that would have increased lipophilicity, thus increasing the likelihood they will cross the blood brain barrier. A series of 3-fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines (23-30) were synthesized and evaluated for their PNMT inhibitory potency and affinity for the alpha2-adrenoceptor. A comparison of these compounds with their isosteric sulfonamides (14, 16, and 18-22) showed that the sulfones were more lipophilic but less potent than their corresponding sulfonamides. Sulfone 24 (hPNMT Ki = 1.3 microM) is the most potent compound in this series and is quite selective for PNMT versus the alpha2-adrenoceptor, but 24 is less potent than the corresponding sulfonamide, 16 (hPNMT Ki = 0.13 microM). We also report the crystal structure of hPNMT in complex with sulfonamide 15, from which a potential hydrogen bond acceptor within the hPNMT active site has been identified, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn39. The interaction of this residue with the sulfonamide -NH- is likely responsible for much of the enhanced inhibitory potency of the sulfonamides versus the sulfones.","Comparison of the binding of 3-fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines with their isosteric sulfonamides to the active site of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase.","3-fluoromethyl-7-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylsulfonyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline| Isoquinolines| Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2| Sulfonamides| Sulfones| Phenylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase",,16,14,5433,,0022-2623,18,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Binding Sites| Brain| Crystallography, X-Ray| Humans| Hydrogen Bonding| In Vitro Techniques| Isoquinolines| Male| Models, Molecular| Molecular Structure| Phenylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase| Radioligand Assay| Rats| Rats, Sprague-Dawley| Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2| Stereoisomerism| Structure-Activity Relationship| Sulfonamides| Sulfones",drug effects| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,10,09,16942016,"Comparative Study| Journal Article| Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",5424,49,2006,2019,,,,,"Comparison of the Binding of 3-Fluoromethyl-7-sulfonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines with Their Isosteric Sulfonamides to the Active Site of Phenylethanolamine<i>N</i>-Methyltransferase",journal-article,10.1021/JM060466D,,"{""MAG"": ""2086767907"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM060466D"", ""CorpusId"": 5007732, ""PubMed"": ""16942016""}",16942016,JournalArticle; Study,efe224fd19656968b8a831e69d135d8c7e8133ed,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Although statins are regarded as generally safe, they are known to cause myopathy and, in rare cases, rhabdomyolysis. Statin-dependent effects on plasma lipids are mediated through the inhibition of HMGR in the hepatocyte, whereas evidence suggests that myotoxicity is due to inhibition of HMGR within the myocyte. Thus, an inhibitor with increased selectivity for hepatocytes could potentially result in an improved therapeutic window. Implementation of a strategy that focused on in vitro potency, compound polarity, cell selectivity, and oral absorption, followed by extensive efficacy and safety modeling in guinea pig and rat, resulted in the identification of compound 1b (BMS-644950).

In this paper some novel triazoloquinoxalin-1-ones 4-25 bearing different substituents on the 2-phenyl and/or 4-amino moiety of the parent 4-amino-1, 2-dihydro-2-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (3) have been synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays at bovine A(1) and A(2A) and cloned human A(3) adenosine receptors (AR). Moreover, the binding activities at the above-mentioned AR subtypes of the 1,4-dione parent compounds 26-31 and their 5-N-alkyl derivatives 33-37 were also evaluated. The substituent on the 2-phenyl ring exerted a different effect on AR subtypes, while replacement of a hydrogen atom of the 4-amino group with suitable substituents yielded selective A(1) or A(3) antagonists. Replacement of a hydrogen atom of the 4-NH(2) with an acyl group, or replacement of the whole 4-NH(2) with a 4-oxo moiety, shifted the binding activity toward the A(3) AR. The binding results allowed elucidation of the structural requirements for the binding of these novel tricyclic derivatives at each receptor subtype. In particular, A(1) and A(2A) binding required the presence of a proton donor group at position-4, while for A(3) affinity the presence of a proton acceptor in this same region was of paramount importance.","1,2,4-Triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one: a versatile tool for the synthesis of potent and selective adenosine receptor antagonists.","Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists| Quinoxalines| Receptor, Adenosine A2A| Receptor, Adenosine A3| Receptors, Purinergic P1",,13,09,1164,,0022-2623,6,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Binding, Competitive| Cattle| Cell Line| Cerebral Cortex| Corpus Striatum| Humans| In Vitro Techniques| Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists| Quinoxalines| Radioligand Assay| Receptor, Adenosine A2A| Receptor, Adenosine A3| Receptors, Purinergic P1| Structure-Activity Relationship",metabolism| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| metabolism,04,07,10737748,Journal Article,1158,43,2000,2019,,,,,"1,2,4-Triazolo[4,3-<i>a</i>]quinoxalin-1-one:  A Versatile Tool for the Synthesis of Potent and Selective Adenosine Receptor Antagonists",journal-article,10.1021/JM991096E,,"{""MAG"": ""2951295585"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM991096E"", ""CorpusId"": 11888753, ""PubMed"": ""10737748""}",10737748,JournalArticle,ddad57447c1c466d6382a1ad6a636a589cc87893,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

A series of analogues with a variety of Michael acceptor units at the 6-position were prepared to define the structural requirements for irreversible inhibition. A particular goal was to determine whether additional functions to increase solubility could be appended to the Michael acceptor. Substituted acrylamides were prepared by direct acylation of the corresponding 6-amines with the requisite acid or acid chloride. Vinylsulfonamide derivatives were obtained by acylation of the amines with chloroethylsulfonyl chloride followed by base-promoted elimination. Vinylsulfone and vinylsulfine derivatives were prepared by oxidation and base elimination of a hydroxyethylthio intermediate. The compounds were evaluated for their inhibition of phosphorylation of the isolated EGFR enzyme and for inhibition of EGF-stimulated autophosphorylation of EGFR in A431 cells and of heregulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of erbB2 in MDA-MB 453 cells. Substitution at the nitrogen of the acrylamide was tolerated only with a methyl group; larger substituents were dystherapeutic, and no substitution at all was tolerated at the acrylamide alpha-carbon. In contrast, while electron-donating groups at the acrylamide beta-carbon were not useful, even quite large electron-withdrawing groups (which increase its electrophilicity) were tolerated. A series of derivatives with solubility-enhancing substituents linked to the acrylamide beta-carbon via amides were potent irreversible inhibitors of isolated EGFR (IC50s = 0.4-1.1 nM), with weakly basic morpholine and imidazole derivatives being the best. Vinylsulfonamides were also potent and irreversible inhibitors, but vinylsulfones and vinylsulfines were reversible and only poorly active. Two compounds were evaluated against A431, H125, and MCF-7 xenografts in nude mice but were inferior in these assays to the clinical trial compound CI-1033.","Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 18. 6-Substituted 4-anilinoquinazolines and 4-anilinopyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidines as soluble, irreversible inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor.",Antineoplastic Agents| Enzyme Inhibitors| Pyrimidines| Quinazolines| ErbB Receptors,,02,10,440,,0022-2623,3,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Antineoplastic Agents| Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor| Enzyme Inhibitors| ErbB Receptors| Inhibitory Concentration 50| Mice| Phosphorylation| Pyrimidines| Quinazolines| Solubility| Structure-Activity Relationship| Transplantation, Heterologous| Tumor Cells, Cultured",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,08,07,11462982,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",429,44,2001,2019,,,,,"Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors. 18. 6-Substituted 4-Anilinoquinazolines and 4-Anilinopyrido[3,4-<i>d</i>]pyrimidines as Soluble, Irreversible Inhibitors of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor",journal-article,10.1021/JM000372I,,"{""MAG"": ""2018388482"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM000372I"", ""CorpusId"": 23889244, ""PubMed"": ""11462982""}",11462982,JournalArticle,fff490e87e052f57f4c0e39841f908b5912d4113,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Here we report on the synthesis and the biological evaluation of compounds that are less polar than NBTI. Compound screening in our laboratory indicated that introduction of an alkylamine substituent at the C(8)-position of N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, 2) led to an increment in affinity for the transport protein. It was investigated whether this would also apply for NBTI derivatives. Two series of C(8)-alkylamine-substituted compounds were prepared, one in which the nitro group was absent (46-58) and another in which the ribose moiety was replaced by a benzyl group (72-75). Comparison of the biological data of these compounds with 6-benzylthioinosine (4, K(i) = 53 nM) and 9-benzyl-6-(4-nitrobenzylsulfanyl)purine (59, K(i) = 135 nM) confirmed the hypothesis. The K(i) values improved upon elongation of the alkylamine chain from methylamine to n-hexylamine with an optimum for n-pentylamine (50, K(i) = 2.3 nM). Substitution with 2-methylbutylamine (52), cyclopropylamine (53), cyclopentylamine (54, 72), and cyclohexylamine (55, 73) revealed that the presence of a bulky group enhanced the affinity. The presence of tertiary amines obtained by substitution with pyrrolidine, piperidine, and morpholine gave only poor results. For both series substitution with cyclopentylamine was most effective. Compound 54 (LUF5942) proved the most active, showing a comparable affinity (K(i) = 0.64 nM) to NBTI but a significantly lower polar surface area.",Inhibition of nucleoside transport proteins by C8-alkylamine-substituted purines.,"Amines| Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1| Nucleoside Transport Proteins| Purines| Receptor, Adenosine A1| SLC29A1 protein, human| Thioinosine| 4-nitrobenzylthioinosine",,17,16,329,,0022-2623,1,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Amines| Animals| Biochemistry| CHO Cells| Cells, Cultured| Cricetinae| Cricetulus| Drug Evaluation, Preclinical| Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1| Erythrocyte Membrane| Humans| Nucleoside Transport Proteins| Purines| Receptor, Adenosine A1| Structure-Activity Relationship| Thioinosine",chemistry| methods| methods| antagonists & inhibitors| drug effects| metabolism| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| pharmacology| drug effects| metabolism| analogs & derivatives| chemistry| pharmacology,02,11,15634027,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",321,48,2005,2017,,,,,Inhibition of Nucleoside Transport Proteins by <i>C</i><sup>8</sup>-Alkylamine-Substituted Purines,journal-article,10.1021/JM049303K,,"{""MAG"": ""1990477206"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM049303K"", ""CorpusId"": 45377901, ""PubMed"": ""15634027""}",15634027,JournalArticle,b6dad1cde377d855ad82fc8cab81676c81ae7624,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

However, its highly polar nature is unfavorable for oral absorption and/or penetration into the CNS. In the search for compounds with lower polarity than NBTI we replaced its ribose moiety by substituted benzyl groups. Halogen, hydroxyl, (trifluoro)methyl(-oxy), nitro, and amine functionalities were among the substituents at the benzyl group. In general, substitution of the benzyl group resulted in a lower affinity for ENT1. Only 2-hydroxyl substitution showed a higher affinity. Most likely this is the result of hydrogen bonding. Substitution at the 2-position of the benzyl group with aryl groups was also addressed. Compared to parent compound carrying a 2-phenylbenzyl group, all synthesized analogues gave higher affinities. Introduction of fluoro, trifluoromethyl, methoxy, and hydroxyl groups at the phenyl group clearly showed that addition to the 4-position was preferable. Despite the highly different character of a ribose and a benzyl group, Ki values in the low nanomolar range were obtained for the benzyl-substituted derivatives.

By means of X-ray crystallography on the human CA II adducts of the two compounds these differences have been rationalized. As all sulfonamides, the two compounds bind in deprotonated form to the Zn(II) ion from the enzyme active site and their organic scaffolds extend throughout the cavity, participating in many interactions with amino acid residues and water molecules. However the pyridine derivative undergoes a tilt of the heterocyclic ring compared to the benzene analog, which leads to a very different orientation of the two scaffolds when bound to the enzyme. This tilt also leads to a clash between a carbon atom from the pyridine ring of the first inhibitor and the OH moiety of Thr200, leading to less effective inhibitory properties of the pyridine versus the benzene sulfonamide derivative. Indeed, ts-SA is a promiscuous, low nanomolar inhibitor of 7 out of 10 human (h) CA isoforms, whereas the pyridine sulfonamide is a low nanomolar inhibitor only of the tumor-associated hCA IX and XII, being less effective against other 9 isoforms. Thus, a difference of one atom (N vs CH) in two isostructural sulfonamides leads to drastic differences of activity, phenomenon understood at the atomic level through the high resolution crystallographic structure and kinetic measurements reported in the paper.

The former lactone contains embedded within its structure an exact glycerol moiety, while in the latter the ring oxygen has been transposed to the other side of the carbonyl group. All target compounds were synthesized as racemates from 1,3-dihydroxy-2-propanone. The 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone proved to be the better template for the construction of DAG surrogates that were demonstrated to have high binding affinities for the biological target, protein kinase C (PK-C). The simplest target compounds derived from this template (3e and 3f) have one of the hydroxyl moieties functionalized either as a myristate or as an oleate ester. The simplest target compound (9c) derived from the ineffective 4,4-bis-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template was investigated only with a myristoyl acyl chain. Reducing the long acyl chain to an acetyl moiety and attaching a compensating lipophilic chain to the lactone ring as an alpha-alkylidene moiety produced compounds 10e and 10f (Z-isomers) and 11e and 11f (E-isomers), which were constructed on the more effective 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template. Targets 14c (Z-isomer) and 15c (E-isomer) were derived, in turn, from 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone. The affinities of these ligands for PK-C were assessed in terms of their ability to displace bound [3H-20]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) from the single isozyme PK-C alpha. The biological data support the hypothesis that the increase in binding affinity for PK-C shown by some of these constrained DAG mimetics appears to be entropic in nature. Two of the designed ligands (10e and 10f) showed the highest affinities (34 and 24 nM, respectively) reported so far for a DAG analogue. Assuming that the interaction between these racemic compounds and PK-C is stereospecific, the potency of the active enantiomer is anticipated to double.",Conformationally constrained analogues of diacylglycerol. 10.

J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 619-627). In pursuing our lead optimization efforts, we designed novel conformationally restricted S-DABOs, 3, featuring a methyl at the benzylic carbon (Y = Me) and at the pyrimidine 5-position (R = Me). Conformational analyses and docking simulations suggested that the presence of both methyls would significantly reduce conformational flexibility without compromising, in the R enantiomers, the capability of fitting into the RT non-nucleoside binding pocket. To develop structure-activity relationships, we prepared several congeners of type 3 belonging to the thymine (R = Me) and uracil (R = H) series, featuring various 2-alkylthio side chains (X = Me, i-Pr, n-Bu, i-Bu, s-Bu, c-pentyl, and c-hexyl) and aryl moieties different from the 2,6-difluorophenyl (Ar = phenyl, 2,6-dichlorophenyl, 1-naphthyl). Moreover, alpha-ethyl derivatives (Y = Et) were included in the synthetic project in addition to alpha-methyl derivatives (Y = Me). All of the new compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity and anti-HIV-1 activity in MT-4 cells, and some of them were assayed against highly purified recombinant wild-type HIV-1 RT using homopolymeric template primers. The results were expressed as CC(50) (cytotoxicity), EC(50) (anti-HIV-1 activity), SI (selectivity, given by the CC(50)/EC(50) ratio), and IC(50) (RT inhibitory activity) values. In the 2,6-difluorobenzylthymine (R = Me) series, methylation of the benzylic carbon improved anti-HIV-1 and RT inhibitory activities together with selectivity. Compound 3w (Ar = 2,6-F(2)-Ph, R = Y = Me, X = c-pentyl) turned out the most potent and selective among the S-DABOs reported to date (CC(50) > 200 microM, EC(50) = 6 nM, IC(50) = 5 nM, and SI > 33 333). Assays performed on the pure enantiomer (+)-3w, much more active than (-)-3w, yielded the following results: CC(50) > 200 microM, EC(50) = 2 nM, IC(50) = 8 nM, and SI > 100 000, under conditions wherein MKC-442 was less active and selective (CC(50) > 200 microM, EC(50) = 30 nM, IC(50) = 40 nM, SI > 6666). The 2,6-difluorophenylethylthymines (R = Me) were generally endowed with higher potency compared with the uracil counterparts (R = H). In the 2,6-difluorophenyl series the best and the least performant 2-alkylthio side chains were the 2-c-pentylthio and the 2-methylthio, respectively. When the methyl at the benzylic carbon was replaced by an ethyl, activity was retained or decreased slightly, thus suggesting that the dimensions of the cavity within the RT hosting this substituent would not be compatible with groups larger than ethyl. Aryl moieties different from the 2,6-difluorophenyl (phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2,6-dichlorophenyl) were generally detrimental to activity, consistent with a favorable electronic effect exerted by the 2,6-fluorines on a putative charge-transfer interaction between the aromatic moieties of the inhibitor and Tyr188.","Structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of conformationally restricted novel 2-alkylthio-6-[1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)alkyl]-3,4-dihydro-5-alkylpyrimidin-4(3H)-ones as non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.","2-(cyclopentylthio)-4-(1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)ethyl)-3,4-dihydro-5-methylpyrimidin-4(3H)-one| Pyrimidines| Pyrimidinones| Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors| HIV Reverse Transcriptase",,16,10,2554,,0022-2623,16,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Cell Line| Drug Design| HIV Reverse Transcriptase| HIV-1| Models, Molecular| Molecular Conformation| Mutation| Pyrimidines| Pyrimidinones| Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors| Structure-Activity Relationship",antagonists & inhibitors| drug effects| genetics| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,08,07,11472208,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2544,44,2001,2019,,,,,"Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Conformationally Restricted Novel 2-Alkylthio-6-[1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)alkyl]- 3,4-dihydro-5-alkylpyrimidin-4(3<i>H</i>)-ones as Non-nucleoside Inhibitors of HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase",journal-article,10.1021/JM010853H,,"{""MAG"": ""2070081151"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM010853H"", ""CorpusId"": 174038, ""PubMed"": ""11472208""}",11472208,JournalArticle,bb21433c74243148fba8ce599da338dd5f1e9ab0,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

The resulting ketone was condensed with hydrazine to form the azaphthalazinone core. The azaphthalazinone cores were alkylated with N-Boc-D-prolinol at N-2 by Mitsunobu reaction, de-protected, and then alkylated at the pyrrolidine nitrogen to provide the target H(1) receptor antagonists. All four mono-azaphthalazinone series had higher affinity (pK(i)) for the human H(1) receptor than azelastine, but were not as potent as the parent non-aza phthalazinone. The 5,8-diazaphthalazinone was equipotent with azelastine. The least potent series were the 7-azaphthalazinones, whereas the 5-azaphthalazinones were the most lipophilic.

Replacement of the N-methyl substituent on the pyrrolidine with the n-butyl group caused an increase in potency (pA(2)) and a corresponding increase in lipophilicity. Introduction of a β-ether oxygen in the n-butyl analogues (2-methoxyethyl group) decreased the H(1) pA(2) slightly, and increased the selectivity against hERG.

Previous structure-activity relationship studies of such tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzamides have focused on the linker that connects the ring systems and the effects of benzamide ring substituents. The present study explores the effects of fusing methylene-, ethylene-, and propylenedioxy rings onto the tetrahydroisoquinoline in place of the two methoxy groups. These modifications decreased sigma(2) affinity by 8- to 12-fold, with no major differences noted with ring size. By contrast, the methylenedioxy analog showed a 10-fold greater sigma(1) affinity than 1, and progressively lower sigma(1) affinities were then noted with increasing ring size.

A series of new analogs, where the amine ring fused to the aromatic ring was varied in size (5-7) and the location of the nitrogen in this ring was modified, has been synthesized and assessed for their σ(1)/σ(2) binding affinity and selectivity. The binding affinity of an open-chained variant of 1 was also evaluated. Only the five-membered ring congener of 1 displayed a higher σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity, derived from a higher σ(2) affinity and a lower σ(1) affinity.

The tert-butyl prodrug 11 did not improve bioavailability, and LC-MS analysis revealed unmetabolized prodrug in the systemic circulation.

In this work, an aromatic ring and/or alkyl residues have been used with an N-propanamide or N-acetamide spacer for the synthesis of a new series of 5,9-dimethyl-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomorphan derivatives (12-22). Data obtained by competition binding assays showed that the mu opioid receptor seems to prefer an interaction with the 6,7-benzomorphan ligands having an N-substituent with a propanamide spacer and less hindered amide. Highly stringent features are required for delta receptor interaction, while an N-acetamide spacer and/or bulkier amide could preferentially lead to kappa receptor selectivity. In the propanamide series, compound 12 (named LP1) displayed high mu affinity (Ki=0.83 nM), good delta affinity (Ki=29 nM) and low affinity for the kappa receptor (Ki=110 nM), with a selectivity ratio delta/mu and kappa/mu of 35.1 and 132.5, respectively. Further, in the adenylyl cyclase assay, LP1 displayed a mu/delta agonist profile, with IC50 values of 4.8 and 12 nM at the mu and delta receptors, respectively. The antinociceptive potency of LP1 in the tail-flick test after sc administration in rat was comparable with the potency of morphine (ED50=2.03 and 2.7 mg/kg, respectively), and was totally reversed by naloxone.

A method was developed to selectively substitute arylamines for halogens at C6 and C8 which utilizes alkali salts of arylamino anions. Regioselectivity was found to be counterion dependent. Potassium and sodium salts add selectively to C6 of 6-chloro-8-iodo-9-(2,3,5-tris-O-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-beta-d-ribofuranosyl)purine (7a) while lithium salts add to C6 and C8 positions.

Other C8-substituted compounds were prepared by way of either C8 lithiation chemistry or palladium cross-coupling reactions. Several of these compounds were potent AKIs (e.g. 10b, AK IC(50) = 0.019 microM) and are more potent than the previous best purine-based AKI 5'-deoxy-5'-aminoadenosine (AK IC(50) = 0.170 microM). AK inhibitory potency was greatest for those compounds with (1)H NMR evidence of a predominant anti glycosyl bond conformation, whereas most analogues adopt a syn conformation because of steric repulsions between the C8 substituent and the ribose group.

We have synthesized few 1,2-dihydroisoquinolines having different functionality at the C-1, C-3, C-7, and N-2 positions for evaluation against HIV-1 integrase (HIV1-IN) inhibitory activity. A direct nitro-Mannich condensation of o-alkynylaldimines and dual activation of o-alkynyl aldehydes by inexpensive cobalt chloride yielded desired compounds. Out of 24 compounds, 4m and 6c came out as potent integrase inhibitors in in vitro strand transfer (ST) assay, with IC50 value of 0.7 and 0.8 μM, respectively. Molecular docking of these compounds in integrase revealed strong interaction between metal and ligands, which stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The ten most active compounds were subjected to antiviral assay. Out of those, 6c reduced the level of p24 viral antigen by 91%, which is comparable to RAL in antiviral assay.

These analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro activity against wild-type (WT), K65R, and R72A RTs. BH(3)-PMEApp and BH(3)-PMPApp exhibit the same inhibition properties as their nonborane analogues on WT RT. However, K65R RT was found hypersensitive to BH(3)-PMEApp and as sensitive as WT RT to BH(3)-PMPApp. Moreover, the presence of the borane group restores incorporation of the analogue by R72A HIV RT, the latter being nearly inactive with regular nucleotides.

Although the binding affinities at the dopamine transporter of rimcazole and cocaine are comparable, rimcazole only depressed locomotor activity in mice and antagonized the stimulant effects produced by cocaine. The neurochemical mechanisms underlying the attenuation of cocaine's effects are not understood, although interaction at a low affinity site/state of the dopamine transporter has been suggested. To explore further this class of compounds, a series of rimcazole analogues was designed and synthesized. Displacement of [(3)H]WIN 35,428 binding at the dopamine transporter in rat caudate-putamen revealed that aromatic substitutions on rimcazole were not well tolerated, generally, with significant reductions in affinity for the 3,6-dibromo (5; K(i) = 3890 nM), 1,3, 6-tribromo (6; K(i) = 30300 nM), 3-amino (8; K(i) = 2400 nM), and 3, 6-dinitro (9; K(i) = 174000 nM) analogues. The N-phenylpropyl group was the only terminal piperazine nitrogen substituent that retained moderate affinity at the dopamine transporter (11; K(i) = 263 nM). Analogues in which the carbazole ring was replaced with a freely rotating diphenylamine moiety were also prepared. Although the diphenylamino analogue in which the terminal piperazine nitrogen was unsubstituted, as in rimcazole, demonstrated relatively low binding affinity at the dopamine transporter (24; K(i) = 813 nM), the N-phenylpropyl analogue was found to have the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter within the series (25; K(i) = 61.0 nM). All of the analogues that had affinity for the dopamine transporter inhibited [(3)H]dopamine uptake in synaptosomes, and potencies for these two effects showed a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.7731, p = 0.0018). Several of the analogues displaced [(3)H]paroxetine from serotonin transporters with moderate to high affinity, with the N-phenylpropyl derivative (11) having the highest affinity (K(i) = 44.5 nM). In contrast, none of the analogues recognized the norepinephrine transporter with an affinity of <1.3 microM. Binding affinities for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors were also determined, and several of the compounds were more potent than rimcazole with affinities ranging from 97 nM to >6 microM at sigma(1) sites and 145 to 1990 nM at sigma(2) sites. The compound with the highest affinity (25) at sigma(1) sites was also the compound with highest affinity at the dopamine transporter. These novel rimcazole analogues may provide important tools with which to characterize the relationship between the low affinity site or state of the dopamine transporter, sigma receptors, and their potential roles in modulating cocaine's psychostimulant actions.","Structure-activity relationships at the monoamine transporters and sigma receptors for a novel series of 9-[3-(cis-3, 5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl]carbazole (rimcazole) analogues.","(3-(3,5-dimethyl-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-1-piperazinyl)propyl)diphenylamine| 9-(3-(3,5-dimethyl-4-(3-phenylpropyl)-1-piperazinyl)propyl)carbazole| Aniline Compounds| Carbazoles| Carrier Proteins| Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Nerve Tissue Proteins| Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Piperazines| Receptors, sigma| Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Slc6a2 protein, rat| Slc6a4 protein, rat| Symporters| rimcazole| Dopamine",,22,09,4455,,0022-2623,21,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Aniline Compounds| Animals| Brain| Carbazoles| Carrier Proteins| Dopamine| Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors| Guinea Pigs| In Vitro Techniques| Male| Membrane Glycoproteins| Membrane Transport Proteins| Nerve Tissue Proteins| Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Piperazines| Protein Binding| Rats| Rats, Sprague-Dawley| Receptors, sigma| Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins| Structure-Activity Relationship| Symporters",chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| metabolism| metabolism| chemistry| metabolism| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| metabolism,11,07,10543888,"Comparative Study| Journal Article| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",4446,42,1999,2019,,,,,"Structure−Activity Relationships at the Monoamine Transporters and σ Receptors for a Novel Series of 9-[3-(<i>cis</i>-3,5-Dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-propyl]carbazole (Rimcazole) Analogues",journal-article,10.1021/JM9902943,,"{""MAG"": ""2056009862"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM9902943"", ""CorpusId"": 38551088, ""PubMed"": ""10543888""}",10543888,JournalArticle; Study,ea3ec03af5853c1938cecfbdc88bc46fcddb64b2,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

The anti-inflammatory action was also demonstrated on human leukocytes, where the compound showed prominent inhibitory activity against human PBML 5-LOX, with an IC(50) value of 0.42 μM, very close to the effect produced by the commonly used standard, NDGA. The compound concentration-dependently inhibited 5-LOX product synthesis, specifically inhibiting cysteinyl leukotriene LTC(4) with an IC(50) value of 1.80 μM, and showed no cell toxicity effects. The anti-inflammatory action does not seem to proceed via redox or metal chelating mechanism since the compound tested negative for these bioactivities. Further tests on cyclooxygenases indicated that the compound acts via a dual LOX/COX inhibitory mechanism, with greater selectivity for 5-LOX and COX-2 (IC(50) value of 0.40 μM). The molecular features that govern the 5-LOX inhibitory activity was thus explored using in silico docking experiments. The residues Ile 553 and Hie 252 were the most important residues in the interaction, each contributing significant energy values of -13.45 (electrostatic) and -5.40 kcal/mol (electrostatic and Van der Waals), respectively. The hydroxyl group of the phloroglucinol core of the compound forms a 2.56Å hydrogen bond with the side chain of the carboxylate group of Ile 553. Both Ile 553 and Hie 252 are crucial amino acid residues which chelate with the metal ion in the active site. Distorting the geometry of these ligands could be the reason for the inhibition activity shown by tHGA. The molecular simulation studies supported the bioassay results and served as a good model for understanding the way tHGA binds in the active site of human 5-LOX enzyme.",Bioassay-guided identification of an anti-inflammatory prenylated acylphloroglucinol from Melicope ptelefolia and molecular insights into its interaction with 5-lipoxygenase.,Acetophenones| Anti-Inflammatory Agents| Free Radical Scavengers| Lipoxygenase Inhibitors| Plant Extracts| Leukotriene C4| Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase,10.1016/j.bmc.2011.09.001,26,21,6347,,1464-3391,21,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Acetophenones| Anti-Inflammatory Agents| Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase| Biological Assay| Cell Survival| Free Radical Scavengers| Humans| Inhibitory Concentration 50| Leukocytes, Mononuclear| Leukotriene C4| Lipoxygenase Inhibitors| Models, Molecular| Molecular Dynamics Simulation| Plant Extracts| Plant Leaves| Rutaceae",chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| metabolism| drug effects| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| enzymology| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| chemistry| isolation & purification| pharmacology| chemistry| chemistry,04,11,21958738,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",6340,19,2012,2013,,,,,Bioassay-guided identification of an anti-inflammatory prenylated acylphloroglucinol from Melicope ptelefolia and molecular insights into its interaction with 5-lipoxygenase,journal-article,10.1016/j.bmc.2011.09.001,,"{""MAG"": ""2065351553"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmc.2011.09.001"", ""CorpusId"": 20200540, ""PubMed"": ""21958738""}",21958738,JournalArticle,b92e99f29f729e59e4ec7b917ea961caf234318e,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry

This compound, N10-(cyanomethyl)-5,8-dideazafolic acid (3), was evaluated for its antifolate and antitumor activities in several biological test systems. Alkylation of diethyl N-(4-aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamate with bromoacetonitrile gave diethyl N-[4-[(cyanomethyl)amino]benzoyl]-L-glutamate (7). Reaction of 7 with 2 amino-6-(bromomethyl)-4-hydroxyquinazoline (9) in dimethylacetamide gave the corresponding diethyl ester 11, which was hydrolyzed to the target compound 3. The known antileukemic agent 2 was also synthesized for comparative studies by employing a modified procedure, which resulted in a better yield of this product. Both compounds 2 and 3 were evaluated for their antifolate activities by using two folate-requiring microorganisms, Streptococcus faecium and Lactobacillus casei. They were further evaluated as inhibitors of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase derived from the above organisms, as well as for their antitumor activity by using selected tumor cells in culture. Compound 2 was found to be as equally potent as methotrexate (MTX) against S. faecium, and it was an excellent inhibitor of L. casei thymidylate synthase. The cyanomethyl analogue 3 was less active than 2 in all the test systems, except the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase.","Folate analogues. 21.

J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 2681-2691) has been performed on a training set of 33 HIV-1 protease inhibitors, and the resulting regression models have been validated using an additional external set of 16 inhibitors. This data set was originally reported by Holloway et al. (J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 305-317), who showed the usefulness of molecular mechanics interaction energies for predicting the activity of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors within the framework of the MM2X force field and linear regression techniques. We first used the AMBER force field on the same set of three-dimensional structures to check up on any possible force-field dependencies. In agreement with the previous findings, the calculated raw ligand-receptor interaction energies were highly correlated with the inhibitory activities (r2 = 0.81), and the linear regression model relating both magnitudes had an acceptable predictive ability both in internal validation tests (q2 = 0.79, SDEPcv = 0.61) and when applied to the external set of 16 different inhibitors (SDEPex = 1.08). When the interaction energies were further analyzed using the COMBINE formalism, the resulting PLS model showed improved fitting properties (r2 = 0.89) and provided better estimations for the activity of the compounds in the external data set (SDEPex = 0.83). Computation of the electrostatic part of the ligand-receptor interactions by numerically solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation did not improve the quality of the linear regression model. On the contrary, incorporation of the solvent-screened residue-based electrostatic interactions and two additional descriptors representing the electrostatic energy contributions to the partial desolvation of both the ligands and the receptor resulted in a COMBINE model that achieved a remarkable predictive ability, as assessed by both internal (q2 = 0.73, SDEPcv = 0.69) and external validation tests (SDEPex = 0.59). Finally, when all the inhibitors studied were merged into a single expanded set, a new model was obtained that explained 91% of the variance in biological activity (r2 = 0.91), with very high predictive ability (q2 = 0.81, SDEPcv = 0.66). In addition, the COMBINE analysis provided valuable information about the relative importance of the contributions to the activity of individual residues that can be fruitfully used to design better inhibitors. All in all, COMBINE analysis is validated as a powerful methodology for predicting binding affinities and pharmacological activities of congeneric ligands that bind to a common receptor.",Comparative binding energy analysis of HIV-1 protease inhibitors: incorporation of solvent effects and validation as a powerful tool in receptor-based drug design.,"HIV Protease Inhibitors| Ligands| Receptors, Cell Surface| Solvents",,16,15,852,,0022-2623,6,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Drug Design| HIV Protease Inhibitors| HIV-1| Ligands| Models, Molecular| Predictive Value of Tests| Receptors, Cell Surface| Solvents| Structure-Activity Relationship| Thermodynamics",chemistry| metabolism| enzymology| metabolism,04,11,9526559,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",836,41,1998,2006,,,,,Comparative Binding Energy Analysis of HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors:  Incorporation of Solvent Effects and Validation as a Powerful Tool in Receptor-Based Drug Design,journal-article,10.1021/JM970535B,,"{""MAG"": ""2118080283"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM970535B"", ""CorpusId"": 20227610, ""PubMed"": ""9526559""}",9526559,JournalArticle,d56a10d7d7381af43600a276cc07deece1e21dbb,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Our strongest inhibitor showed an IC50-material value and selectivity for APC vs thrombin similar to a compound previously reported in the literature. However, in contrast to the reference compound, our compound showed a retained coagulant effect of thrombin with increasing substrate concentration in a modified Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) method. This was likely related to our compound being inactive against FVIIa, while the reference compound showed an IC50 of 8.9 μM. Thus, the higher selectivity of our compound against all relevant coagulation factors likely explained its higher therapeutic potential in comparison to the reference compound. The data indicate that at least a 100-fold selectivity over other serine proteases in the coagulation cascade will be required for an effective APC inhibitor.","Design, synthesis, and SAR of a series of activated protein C (APC) inhibitors with selectivity against thrombin for the treatment of haemophilia.",Coagulants| Protein C Inhibitor| Thrombin,10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.094,04,27,827,,1464-3405,3,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,Binding Sites| Coagulants| Drug Design| Hemophilia A| Inhibitory Concentration 50| Protein Binding| Protein C Inhibitor| Structure-Activity Relationship| Substrate Specificity| Thrombin,chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| drug therapy| drug effects| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors,11,01,24418773,Journal Article,821,24,2014,2014,,,,,"Design, synthesis, and SAR of a series of activated protein C (APC) inhibitors with selectivity against thrombin for the treatment of haemophilia",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.094,,"{""MAG"": ""2038007668"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.12.094"", ""CorpusId"": 13417266, ""PubMed"": ""24418773""}",24418773,JournalArticle,c23da337f52a7a426c6122241c3e104a21fd73d5,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

Compounds included in this study were the clinically used sulfonamide CA inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide, topiramate, valdecoxib, celecoxib, dorzolamide, sulfanilamide, dichlorophanamide, as well as sulfanilamide analogs, halogenated sulfanilamides, and some 1,3-benzenedisulfonamide derivatives. The two gamma-CAs from Methanosarcina thermophila (Zn-Cam and Co-Cam) showed very different inhibitory properties with these compounds, as compared to the alpha-CA isozymes hCA I, II, and IX, and the beta-CA from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Cab). The best Zn-Cam inhibitors were sulfamic acid and acetazolamide, with inhibition constants in the range of 63-96 nM, whereas other investigated aromatic/heterocylic sulfonamides showed a rather levelled behavior, with KIs in the range of 0.12-1.70 microM. The best Co-Cam inhibitors were topiramate and p-aminoethyl-benzenesulfonamide, with KIs in the range of 0.12-0.13 microM, whereas the worst one was homosulfanilamide (KI of 8.50 microM). In the case of Cab, the inhibitory power of these compounds varied to a much larger extent, with sulfamic acid and sulfamide showing millimolar affinities (KIs in the range of 44-103 mM), whereas the best inhibitor was ethoxzolamide, with a KI of 5.35 microM. Most of these sulfonamides showed inhibition constants in the range of 12-100 microM against Cab.

A related dual COX-1/2 and 5/15-LOX inhibitor 3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-1-(4-cyanophenyl)prop-2-yn-1-one (13g, COX-1 IC50 = 31.5 microM; COX-2 IC50 = 1.0 microM; SI = 31.5; 5-LOX IC50 = 1.0 microM; 15-LOX IC50 = 3.2 microM) exhibited more potent antiinflammatory activity (ED50 = 90 mg/kg), being superior to the reference drug aspirin (ED50 = 129 mg/kg). Within this group of compounds 3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-1-(4-isopropylphenyl)prop-2-yn-1-one (13e) emerged as having an optimal combination of in vitro COX-1/2 and 5/15-LOX inhibitory effects (COX-1 IC50 = 9.2 microM; COX-2 IC50 = 0.32 microM; SI = 28; 5-LOX IC50 = 0.32 microM; 15-LOX IC50 = 0.36 microM) in conjunction with a good antiinflammatory activity (ED50 = 35 mg/kg) compared to the reference drug celecoxib (ED50 = 10.8 mg/kg) when administered orally. A molecular modeling study where 13e was docked in the COX-2 binding site indicated the C-1 p-i-Pr group was positioned within a hydrophobic pocket (Phe205, Val344, Val349, Phe381 and Leu534), and that this positioning of the i-Pr group facilitated orientation of the C-3 p-SO2Me COX-2 pharmacophore such that it inserted into the COX-2 secondary pocket (His90, Arg513, Ile517 and Val523). A related docking study of 13e in the 15-LOX binding site indicates that the C-3 p-SO2Me COX-2 pharmacophore was positioned in a region closer to the catalytic iron site where it undergoes a hydrogen bonding interaction with His541 and His366, and that the C-1 p-i-Pr substituent is buried deep in a hydrophobic pocket (Ile414, Ile418, Met419 and Ile593) near the base of the 15-LOX binding site.","Synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of 1,3-diarylprop-2-yn-1-ones: dual inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases.",Alkynes| Analgesics| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors| Lipoxygenase Inhibitors| methylacetylene| Carrageenan| Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase| Cyclooxygenase 1| Cyclooxygenase 2,,25,19,1683,,0022-2623,5,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Administration, Oral| Alkynes| Analgesics| Animals| Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase| Carrageenan| Cyclooxygenase 1| Cyclooxygenase 2| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors| Edema| Lipoxygenase Inhibitors| Mice| Models, Molecular| Pain Measurement| Rats| Structure-Activity Relationship",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| chemistry| metabolism| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemically induced| drug therapy| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,04,11,16509583,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1668,49,2006,2015,Missing DOI,,,,,,,PMID not found,,16509583,,,
