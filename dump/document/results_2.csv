N-malonyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline redox carrier system was linked through amidic bond to 4-chloro and 4-nitrobenzylidenehydrazines (9a-b), as monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and β-phenethylamine (14), as a model drug, to afford a novel group of N-malonyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline chemical delivery systems (DHIQCDSs) (13a-b and 18). These systems are expected to be stable against air oxidation due to the presence of the carbonyl group close to nitrogen of the dihydroisoquinoline. The synthesized DHIQCDS (18) was subjected to various chemical and biological investigations to evaluate its stability and prove its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and ""lock-in"" the brain. The in vitro chemical and enzymatic oxidation studies showed reasonable stability and adequate rate of conversion of DHIQCDS (18) to its corresponding quaternary metabolites. In vivo distribution study in rats revealed preferential concentration of the active moiety in the brain. Moreover, compounds (9a-b, 12a-b and 17) were screened for their in vitro MAO inhibitory activity compared to clorgyline as a reference compound. The inhibition profile was found to be competitive for both MAO-A and MAO-B isozymes with more selectivity toward MAO-A. Molecular docking study of compounds (9a-b, 12a-b and 17) and the suggested metabolites was carried out on both MAO-A and MAO-B isozymes. Observation of the docked poses revealed many interactions with many residues previously reported to have an effect on the inhibition of MAO enzyme.","Synthesis, biological investigation and molecular docking study of N-malonyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline derivatives as brain specific and shelf-stable MAO inhibitors.","Isoquinolines| Malonates| Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors| N-malonyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline| Monoamine Oxidase",10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.02.039,21,13,491,,1768-3254,0,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Brain| Catalytic Domain| Cattle| Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic| Drug Stability| Female| Isoquinolines| Malonates| Molecular Docking Simulation| Monoamine Oxidase| Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors| Organ Specificity| Rabbits| Rats",drug effects| enzymology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| pharmacology| chemistry| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| pharmacology,12,03,25732770,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",481,93,2015,2015,,,,,"Synthesis, biological investigation and molecular docking study of N-malonyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline derivatives as brain specific and shelf-stable MAO inhibitors",journal-article,10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.02.039,,"{""MAG"": ""2044985057"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.02.039"", ""CorpusId"": 9808528, ""PubMed"": ""25732770""}",25732770,JournalArticle,423be1d19a2934180788d80287718ae710f262ef,European journal of medicinal chemistry

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) data, acquired by substituent modification at the para-position of the C-6 phenyl ring attached to the central pyranone, showed that 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-4-phenylpyran-2-one (12e) was the most potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.02 microM; COX-1 IC(50) > 100 microM) with a high COX-2 selectivity index (SI > 5000) relative to the reference drugs celecoxib (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.07 microM; SI = 474) and rofecoxib (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.50 microM; SI > 200). 6-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-4-phenylpyran-2-one (12e) was a more potent oral antiinflammatory agent (ID(50) = 5.6 mg/kg) than celecoxib (ID(50) = 10.8 mg/kg) in a carrageenan-induced rat paw edema assay. In a 4% NaCl-induced abdominal constriction assay, a 5 mg/kg oral dose of 12e exhibited good analgesic activity at different time intervals producing 37.5 and 69% inhibition of writhing at 30 and 60 min, respectively. In contrast, the corresponding 6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-3-phenylpyran-2-one regiosiomer (12o) was a less potent and selective COX-2 inhibitor (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.45 microM; SI = 70). A molecular modeling study for 12e indicated that the p-OMe substituent on the C-6 phenyl ring interacts with the COX-2 binding site amino acids Ile(345), Val(349), Leu(359), Leu(531), and Met(535) and that the OMe substituent may be responsible for proper orientation of the C-3 p-SO(2)Me-phenyl ring within the COX-2 secondary pocket (Gln(192), Arg(513), and Phe(518)). These results show that the COX-2 selectivity and potency of 3,4,6-triphenylpyranone regioisomers can be modulated by appropriate placement of the p-SO(2)Me pharmacophore on either the C-3 or C-4 phenyl moiety. In addition, electronic properties at the para-position of a C-6 phenyl substituent on the central pyranone ring govern COX-2 inhibitory potency and selectivity by controlling the orientation of the p-SO(2)Me pharmacophore within the COX-2 secondary pocket.","Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of 3,4,6-triphenylpyran-2-ones as selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.","6-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3-(4-methanesulfonylphenyl)-4-phenylpyran-2-one| Analgesics| Isoenzymes| Membrane Proteins| Pyrans| Pyrones| Sulfones| Carrageenan| Cyclooxygenase 1| Cyclooxygenase 2| Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases| Ptgs1 protein, rat",,24,15,3990,,0022-2623,16,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Analgesics| Animals| Carrageenan| Cyclooxygenase 1| Cyclooxygenase 2| Edema| Isoenzymes| Membrane Proteins| Models, Molecular| Pain Measurement| Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases| Pyrans| Pyrones| Rats| Stereoisomerism| Structure-Activity Relationship| Sulfones",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemically induced| drug therapy| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| methods| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology,08,11,15267236,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",3972,47,2004,2006,Missing DOI,,,,,,,PMID not found,,15267236,,,

Although selectivities were lower than with TMP, the activities against vertebrate DHFR were usually at least 2 orders of magnitude less than against enzymes from microbial sources. However, the profiles of activity were remarkably similar for rat, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Plasmodium berghei enzymes in all three series, although somewhat different for Escherichia coli DHFR, leading to the conclusion that the hydrophobic pockets are similar for the first three isozymes. Optimal substitution was reached with 3,5-di-n-propyl or 3-ethyl-5-n-propyl groups. Branching of chains at the alpha-carbon, which resulted in increased substituent thickness, was detrimental to E. coli DHFR inhibition in particular. MR is an inadequate parameter for use in correlating such substituent effects. Conformational changes of the more bulky inhibitors can be invoked to explain some differences in inhibitory pattern. Although log P explains simple substituent effects with the vertebrate DHFRs very well, it is insufficient in the more complex cases described here, where shape is clearly involved as well. Solvent-accessible surface areas were measured for TMP in E. coli and chicken DHFRs, where the coordinates are now known. The environment is more hydrophobic in the latter case; this can also be postulated for rat DHFR, which has a very similar activity profile. As with the mammalian isozymes, N. gonorrhoeae DHFR contains an active site phenylalanine replacing Leu-28 of E. coli DHFR, thus creating a more hydrophobic pocket. A similar replacement may also occur in the P.berghei isozyme. Selectivity for bacterial DHFR is dependent on the nature of the 4-substituent, being low for polar 4-hydroxy compounds but high for polar 4-amino analogues, possibly as a result of solvation differences. With complex substituents, the environment of each atom in the active site must be taken into account to adequately explain structure-activity relationships.","2,4-Diamino-5-benzylpyrimidines as antibacterial agents. 7.

Dichlorophenamide, zonisamide, saccharin and hydrochlorothiazide were weaker inhibitors, with K(I)s in the range of 513-5390 nM. The inhibition profile with anions and sulfonamides of the seal enzyme was rather different from those of the human isoforms hCA I and II.

To better understand the enzyme-inhibitor interaction and to explain the selectivity of the most active compounds toward hMAOs, molecular modeling studies were carried out on new, high resolution, hMAO-A and hMAO-B crystallographic structures.","Synthesis, molecular modeling, and selective inhibitory activity against human monoamine oxidases of 3-carboxamido-7-substituted coumarins.",Coumarins| Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors| Monoamine Oxidase,10.1021/jm801496u,28,02,1942,,1520-4804,7,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Coumarins| Crystallography, X-Ray| Humans| Models, Molecular| Monoamine Oxidase| Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors| Structure-Activity Relationship",chemical synthesis| chemistry| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry,04,04,19267475,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",1935,52,2009,2009,,,,,"Synthesis, Molecular Modeling, and Selective Inhibitory Activity against Human Monoamine Oxidases of 3-Carboxamido-7-Substituted Coumarins",journal-article,10.1021/jm801496u,,"{""MAG"": ""2058105012"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/jm801496u"", ""CorpusId"": 22319677, ""PubMed"": ""19267475""}",19267475,JournalArticle,a94d9b338ecacdb0d073b94259619ff4c8d087bb,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Several ligands endowed with high binding affinity at hA(2B) receptors, excellent selectivity over hA(2A) and hA(3) and a significant, but lower, selectivity over hA(1) were identified.

These isozymes have their CA domains located extracellularly, unlike the physiologically dominant hCA II, and are of immense current interest as druggable targets. Elevated expression of isozymes IX and XII is a marker for a broad spectrum of hypoxic tumors-this physiology may facilitate a novel approach to discriminate between healthy cells and cancerous cells. Many of these glycoconjugates were potent inhibitors (low nM), but importantly exhibited different isozyme selectivity profiles. The most potent hCA IX inhibitor was the glucuronic acid derivative 20 (K(i)=23nM). This compound was uniquely hCA IX selective cf. all other isozymes (16.4-, 16.8- and 4.6-fold selective against hCA II, XII, and XIV, respectively). At hCA XII there were many inhibitors with K(i)s<10nM that also demonstrated excellent selectivity (up to 344-fold) against other isozymes. Potent hCA XIV inhibitors were also identified, several with K(i)s approximately 10nM, however no hCA XIV-selective derivatives were evidenced from this library. The sugar tails of this study have shown promise as a valuable approach to both solubilize the aromatic sulfonamide CA recognition pharmacophore and to deliver potent inhibition and isozyme differentiation of the transmembrane CAs.","Inhibition of membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase isozymes IX, XII and XIV with a library of glycoconjugate benzenesulfonamides.",Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Glycoconjugates| Isoenzymes| Recombinant Proteins| Sulfonamides| Phenolsulfonphthalein,,13,21,992,,0960-894X,4,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Cyclization| Glycoconjugates| Humans| Isoenzymes| Membranes| Phenolsulfonphthalein| Recombinant Proteins| Sulfonamides,chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| enzymology| chemistry| chemical synthesis| pharmacology,04,11,17157501,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",987,17,2007,2013,,,,,"Inhibition of membrane-associated carbonic anhydrase isozymes IX, XII and XIV with a library of glycoconjugate benzenesulfonamides",journal-article,10.1016/J.BMCL.2006.11.046,,"{""MAG"": ""1986865943"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/J.BMCL.2006.11.046"", ""CorpusId"": 25012620, ""PubMed"": ""17157501""}",17157501,JournalArticle,aef87ffe8c08dae3b7741a5600b8986c99bad456,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

The StaR and a panel of binding site mutants are captured onto Biacore chips to enable characterization of the binding of small molecule ligands using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement. A matrix of binding data for a set of ligands versus each active site mutation is then generated, providing specific affinity and kinetic information (K(D), k(on), and k(off)) of receptor-ligand interactions. This data set, in combination with molecular modeling and docking, is used to map the small molecule binding site for each class of compounds.

The X-ray structure of bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase complexed with the phosphonic acid analogue of leucine (LeuP) was used for structure-based design of novel LAP inhibitors and for the analysis of their interactions with the enzyme binding site. The inhibitors were designed by modification of phosphonic group in the LeuP structure toward finding the substituents bound at the S' side of the enzyme. This resulted in two classes of compounds, the phosphonamidate and phosphinate dipeptide analogues, which were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of the enzyme. The in vitro kinetic studies for the phosphinate dipeptide analogues revealed that these compounds belong to the group of the most effective LAP inhibitors found so far. Their further modification at the P1 position resulted in more active inhibitors, hPheP[CH(2)]Phe and hPheP[CH(2)]Tyr (K(i) values 66 nM and 67 nM, respectively, for the mixture of four diastereomers). The binding affinities of these inhibitors toward the enzyme are the highest, if considering all compounds containing a phosphorus atom that mimic the transition state of the reaction catalyzed by LAP. To evaluate selectivity of the designed LAP inhibitors, additional tests toward aminopeptidase N (APN) were performed. The key feature, which determines their selectivity, is structure at the P1' position. Aromatic and aliphatic substituents placed at this position strongly interact with the LAP S1' binding pocket, while a significant increase in binding affinity toward APN was observed for compounds containing aromatic versus leucine side chains at the P1' position. The most selective inhibitor, hPheP[CH(2)]Leu, binds to LAP with 15 times higher affinity than to APN. One of the studied compounds, hPheP[CH(2)]Tyr, appeared to be very potent inhibitor of APN (K(i) = 36 nM for the mixture of four diastereomers). The most promising LAP inhibitors designed by computer-aided approach, the phosphonamidate dipeptide analogues, were unstable at pH below 12, because of the P-N bond decomposition, which excluded the possibility of determination of their binding affinities toward LAP.","The most potent organophosphorus inhibitors of leucine aminopeptidase.

A preferential amide torsion that improved the binding properties of the compounds was identified for this series via computational analysis. Cyclization of the amide linker resulted in a six-membered lactam analogue, compound 18. This transformation significantly improved the ligand efficiency/potency of the cyclized compound relative to its acyclic analogue. Additional optimization of the lactam-containing EZH2 inhibitors focused on lipophilic efficiency (LipE) improvement, which provided compound 31. Compound 31 displayed improved LipE and on-target potency in both biochemical and cellular readouts relative to compound 18. Inhibitor 31 also displayed robust in vivo antitumor growth activity and dose-dependent de-repression of EZH2 target genes.","Design and Synthesis of Pyridone-Containing 3,4-Dihydroisoquinoline-1(2H)-ones as a Novel Class of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) Inhibitors.","1,5-dihydroisoquinoline| Antineoplastic Agents| Isoquinolines| Lactams| Pyridones| Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein",10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00515,12,20,8325,,1520-4804,18,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Antineoplastic Agents| Cell Line, Tumor| Cyclization| Drug Design| Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein| Female| Humans| Isoquinolines| Lactams| Mice| Mice, SCID| Models, Molecular| Neoplasms| Pyridones",chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use| chemistry| pharmacology| drug therapy| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use,06,03,27512831,Journal Article,8306,59,2017,2019,,,,,"Design and Synthesis of Pyridone-Containing 3,4-Dihydroisoquinoline-1(2<i>H</i>)-ones as a Novel Class of Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) Inhibitors",journal-article,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00515,,"{""MAG"": ""2513637319"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b00515"", ""CorpusId"": 206618589, ""PubMed"": ""27512831""}",27512831,JournalArticle,d01ec4bc38d5774e3ae76c5673a109ac35405a15,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

METHODS: A synthetic reaction based on 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition mechanism was applied for the regiospecific formation of various spiroisoxazolines. The activity of the newly synthesized compounds was determined using in vitro cyclooxygenase inhibition assay. The toxicity of the compounds was evaluated by MTT assay. In addition, induction of apoptosis, and expression levels of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 mRNA in MCF-7 cells were evaluated following exposure to compound 9f. The docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulation were performed to study the most probable modes of interactions of compound 9f upon binding to COX-2 enzyme. RESULTS: The docking results showed that the synthesized compounds were able to form hydrogen bonds with COX-2 involving methyl sulfonyl, spiroisoxazoline, meta-methoxy and fluoro functional groups. Spiroisoxazoline derivatives containing methoxy group at the C-3' phenyl ring meta position (9f and 9g) showed superior selectivity with higher potency of inhibiting COX-2 enzyme. Furthermore, compound 9f, which possesses 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl on C-3' carbon atom of isoxazoline ring, exhibited the highest COX-2 inhibitory activity, and also displayed the most potent cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells with an IC CONCLUSION: In vitro biological evaluations accompanied with in silico studies revealed that indanone tricyclic spiroisoxazoline derivatives are good candidates for the development of new anti-inflammatory and anticancer (colorectal and breast) agents.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel indanone containing spiroisoxazoline derivatives with selective COX-2 inhibition as anticancer agents.",Antineoplastic Agents| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Indans| Isoxazoles| Spiro Compounds| Cyclooxygenase 2,10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115960,14,14,0,,1464-3391,0,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Antineoplastic Agents| Apoptosis| Cell Proliferation| Cells, Cultured| Cyclooxygenase 2| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Dose-Response Relationship, Drug| Drug Design| Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor| Humans| Indans| Isoxazoles| Molecular Structure| Spiro Compounds| Structure-Activity Relationship",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| drug effects| drug effects| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| pharmacology,09,09,33477020,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",115960,32,2021,2021,,,,,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel indanone containing spiroisoxazoline derivatives with selective COX-2 inhibition as anticancer agents",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115960,,"{""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmc.2020.115960"", ""CorpusId"": 231680509, ""PubMed"": ""33477020""}",33477020,JournalArticle,4ed8b81472f2a0737f29e67f8ed9168cf100a51e,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry

C-3-Substituted pyrroloquinazolines were prepared by Mannich base chemistry. A series of compounds bearing solubilizing side chains at these positions has been prepared and evaluated for inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the isolated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of its autophosphorylation in EGF-stimulated A431 cells. Several analogues, particularly C-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines, retained high potency in both assays. A model for the binding of the general class of 4-anilinoquinazolines to the EGFR was constructed from structural information (particularly for the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase) and structure-activity relationships (SAR) in the series. In this model, the pyrrole ring in pyrroloquinazolines (and the 6- and 7-positions of quinazoline and related pyridopyrimidine inhibitors) occupies the entrance of the ATP binding pocket of the enzyme, with the pyrrole nitrogen located at the bottom of the cleft and the pyrrole C-3 position pointing toward a pocket corresponding to the ribose binding site of ATP. This allows considerable bulk tolerance for C-3 substituents and lesser but still significant bulk tolerance for N-1 substituents. The observed high selectivity of these compounds for binding to EGFR over other similar tyrosine kinases is attributed to the 4-anilino ring binding in an adjacent hydrophobic pocket which has an amino acid composition unique to the EGFR. The SAR seen for inhibition of the isolated enzyme by the pyrazolo- and pyrroloquinazolines discussed here is fully consistent with this binding model. For the N-1-substituted compounds, inhibition of autophosphorylation in A431 cells correlates well with inhibition of the isolated enzyme, as seen previously for related pyridopyrimidines. However, the C-3-substituted pyrroloquinazolines show unexpectedly high potencies in the autophosphorylation assay, making them of particular interest.","Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 11.

Bulky groups, like adamantane and alkyl chains with more than four carbon atoms, are detrimental for the affinity and the selectivity of the A3 adenosine receptor agonists described here.",Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel N6-[4-(substituted)sulfonamidophenylcarbamoyl]adenosine-5'-uronamides as A3 adenosine receptor agonists.,Adenosine A1 Receptor Agonists| Adenosine A2 Receptor Agonists| Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists| Amides| Ligands| Sulfonamides| Uronic Acids| Cyclic AMP| Adenosine,,03,21,5540,,0022-2623,22,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Adenosine| Adenosine A1 Receptor Agonists| Adenosine A2 Receptor Agonists| Adenosine A3 Receptor Agonists| Amides| Animals| CHO Cells| Cricetinae| Cricetulus| Cyclic AMP| Humans| Ligands| Radioligand Assay| Structure-Activity Relationship| Sulfonamides| Uronic Acids,analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| biosynthesis| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry,12,11,15481989,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5535,47,2004,2013,,,,,Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Novel <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-[4-(Substituted)sulfonamidophenylcarbamoyl]adenosine-5‘-uronamides as A<sub>3</sub> Adenosine Receptor Agonists,journal-article,10.1021/JM0408161,,"{""MAG"": ""2166809208"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM0408161"", ""CorpusId"": 10544107, ""PubMed"": ""15481989""}",15481989,JournalArticle,a05d77749fa972f9d12b0a4ff77d2396e0d31d46,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

The best binding profiles were determined for homologues bearing monocyclic and bicyclic monoterpenic substituents at the carbamoyl group at 3 position of the pyrazole ring (KiCB2 < 4 nM). In particular, the isopinocampheyl-substituted derivative 22 exhibited the highest selectivity for CB2 receptors with Ki values of 3.7 and 2398 nM for CB2 and CB1 receptors, respectively.

Nucleoside protection assays establish compound 8 a dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (AICARFTase) targeting both de novo thymidylate and purine nucleotide biosynthesis, which is further verified by the molecular modeling studies. Analogous to PMX, target compound 8 alternates the cell cycle of SW620 cells with S-phase accumulation and induces apoptosis, leading to cell death.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as dual inhibitors of TS and AICARFTase and as potential antitumor agents.",Antineoplastic Agents| Enzyme Inhibitors| Pyrimidines| Pyrroles| Thymidylate Synthase| Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase,10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.03.032,09,10,256,,1768-3254,0,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Antineoplastic Agents| Cell Line, Tumor| Drug Design| Enzyme Inhibitors| Humans| Models, Molecular| Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase| Pyrimidines| Pyrroles| Thymidylate Synthase",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| antagonists & inhibitors,01,01,27017552,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",245,115,2017,2017,,,,,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 6-substituted pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as dual inhibitors of TS and AICARFTase and as potential antitumor agents",journal-article,10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.03.032,,"{""MAG"": ""2311535851"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.03.032"", ""CorpusId"": 32061023, ""PubMed"": ""27017552""}",27017552,JournalArticle,78a78dfd3a3daacf77780617b48590abcac34e75,European journal of medicinal chemistry

Some of the new derivatives also showed selectivity for inhibition of hCA IX over hCA II (selectivity ratios of 23.33-32.00), thus constituting excellent leads for the development of novel approaches for the management of hypoxic tumours.","Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: novel sulfonamides incorporating 1,3,5-triazine moieties as inhibitors of the cytosolic and tumour-associated carbonic anhydrase isozymes I, II and IX.","Antigens, Neoplasm| Antineoplastic Agents| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Isoenzymes| Sulfonamides| Triazines| Carbonic Anhydrase I| Carbonic Anhydrase II| CA9 protein, human| Carbonic Anhydrase IX| Carbonic Anhydrases",,19,24,3108,,0960-894X,12,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,"Antigens, Neoplasm| Antineoplastic Agents| Carbonic Anhydrase I| Carbonic Anhydrase II| Carbonic Anhydrase IX| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Carbonic Anhydrases| Cell Membrane| Cytosol| Humans| Isoenzymes| Molecular Structure| Structure-Activity Relationship| Sulfonamides| Triazines",chemistry| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| metabolism| chemistry| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| metabolism| enzymology| enzymology| antagonists & inhibitors| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry,09,11,15905091,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",3102,15,2005,2016,,,,,"Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: Novel sulfonamides incorporating 1,3,5-triazine moieties as inhibitors of the cytosolic and tumour-associated carbonic anhydrase isozymes I, II and IX",journal-article,10.1016/J.BMCL.2005.04.056,,"{""MAG"": ""2045271160"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/J.BMCL.2005.04.056"", ""CorpusId"": 25758527, ""PubMed"": ""15905091""}",15905091,JournalArticle,f530976138ea297d419d98a707b5653355784033,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

In in vitro assays these ligands, showed very good binding affinity and highly selective toward the μ opioid receptor. Among these, the lead ligand 20 showed excellent binding affinity (2 nM) and 5000 fold selectivity toward the μ opioid receptor, as well as functional selectivity in GPI assays (55.20 ± 4.30 nM) and weak or no agonist activities in MVD assays.

This discrepancy between high in vitro binding affinity, moderate in vitro activity, and low in vivo activity may reflect differences in pharmacodynamics (i.e., engaging signaling pathways) or pharmacokinetics (i.e., metabolic stability).

However, the pharmacokinetic properties of MT802 were not suitable for further in vivo development. Therefore, we undertook a systematic medicinal chemistry campaign to overcome this issue and made a series of PROTACs with structural modifications to the linker and E3-recruiting ligand; more specifically, the new PROTACs were synthesized with different von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and cereblon (CRBN) ligands while keeping the BTK ligand and linker length constant.

All the described compounds contain arylacetyl moieties at the N5 position and arylalkyl substituents at the N8 position. Surprisingly, all the compounds present their most potent affinities at the hA(2B) adenosine receptor with a range of selectivities against the other subtypes. When bulky groups are present simultaneously at the N5 and N8 positions (e.g., compound 9), the best selectivity for the hA(2B) receptor was observed (K(i)(hA(1)) = 1100 nM; K(i)(hA(2A)) = 800 nM; K(i)(hA(2B)) = 20 nM; K(i)(hA(3)) = 300 nM, K(i)(hA(1)/A(2B)) = 55, K(i)(hA(2A)/A(2B)) = 40, K(i)(hA(3)/hA(2B)) = 15). To understand the molecular significance of these results, we compared the putative TM (transmembrane) binding motif of compound 9 on both hA(2B) and hA(3) receptors. From our docking studies, compound 9 fits neatly inside the TM region of the hA(2B) receptor but not in the corresponding hA(3) region, illustrating significant differences between the two subtypes. The study herein presented permits an understanding of why the bioisosteric replacement of an -NH, present in previously reported hA(3) receptor antagonists, with a -CH(2) group at the N5 position induces such large differences in hA(2B)/hA(3) affinity. In the molecular structure of the hA(3) receptor, two residues, Ser243 (TM6) and Ser271 (TM7), create a hydrophilic region, which seems to permit a better accommodation of the phenylurea series into this putative hA(3) binding site than the phenylacetyl series.","Pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives as adenosine receptor antagonists.

The compounds represent an extension and an improvement of our previous work on this class of compounds (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4473-4478; J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4768-4780). All the synthesized compounds showed A(3) adenosine receptor affinity in the subnanomolar range and high levels of selectivity in radioligand binding assays at the human A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. In particular, the effect of the substitution and its position on the phenyl ring have been studied. From binding data, it is evident that the unsubstituted derivatives on the phenyl ring (e.g., compound 59, hA(3) = 0.16 nM, hA(1)/hA(3) = 3713, hA(2A)/hA(3) = 2381, hA(2B)/hA(3) = 1388) showed the best profile in terms of affinity and selectivity at the human A(3) adenosine receptors. The introduction of a sulfonic acid moiety at the para position on the phenyl ring was attempted in order to design water soluble derivatives. However, this substitution led to a dramatic decrease of affinity at all four adenosine receptor subtypes. A computer-generated model of the human A(3) receptor was built and analyzed to better interpret these results, demonstrating that steric control, in particular at the para position on the phenyl ring, plays a fundamental role in the receptor interaction. Some of the synthesized compounds proved to be full antagonists in a specific functional model, where the inhibition of cAMP-generation by IB-MECA was measured in membranes of CHO cells stably transfected with the human A(3) receptor with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range, with a statistically significative linear relationship with the binding data.","Synthesis, biological activity, and molecular modeling investigation of new pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives as human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonists.","Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists| Pyrimidines| Receptor, Adenosine A3| Receptors, Purinergic P1| Cyclic AMP",,07,10,780,,0022-2623,4,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| CHO Cells| Cricetinae| Cyclic AMP| Humans| Models, Molecular| Protein Structure, Secondary| Purinergic P1 Receptor Antagonists| Pyrimidines| Radioligand Assay| Receptor, Adenosine A3| Receptors, Purinergic P1| Structure-Activity Relationship| Transfection",biosynthesis| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| metabolism,03,07,11831890,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",770,45,2002,2019,,,,,"Synthesis, Biological Activity, and Molecular Modeling Investigation of New Pyrazolo[4,3-<i>e</i>]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-<i>c</i>]pyrimidine Derivatives as Human A<sub>3</sub> Adenosine Receptor Antagonists",journal-article,10.1021/JM0109614,,"{""MAG"": ""2040740996"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM0109614"", ""CorpusId"": 84831310, ""PubMed"": ""11831890""}",11831890,JournalArticle,7e3b4294f70855d3ab2956d48b62cd96f7c2364b,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

A database of 246 compounds was collected for this study; all organic chemicals were reported as tyrosinase inhibitors; they had great structural diversity. This dataset can be considered as a helpful tool, not only for theoretical chemists but also for other researchers in this area. The set used as inactive has 412 drugs with other clinical uses. Twelve LDA-based QSAR models were obtained, the first six using the non-stochastic total and local bond-based linear indices as well as the last six ones, the stochastic molecular descriptors. The best two discriminant models computed using the non-stochastic and stochastic molecular descriptors (Eqs. , respectively) had globally good classifications of 98.95% and 89.75% in the training set, with high Matthews correlation coefficients (C) of 0.98 and 0.78. The external prediction sets had accuracies of 98.89% and 89.44%, and (C) values of 0.98 and 0.78, for models 7 and 13, respectively. A virtual screening of compounds reported in the literature with such activity was carried out, to prove the ability of present models to search for tyrosinase inhibitors, not included in the training or test set. At the end, the fitted discriminant functions were used in the selection/identification of new ethylsteroids isolated from herbal plants, looking for tyrosinase inhibitory activity. A good behavior is shown between the theoretical and experimental results on mushroom tyrosinase enzyme. It might be highlighted that all the compounds showed values under 10microM and that ES2 (IC(50)=1.25microM) showed higher activity in the inhibition against the enzyme than reference compounds kojic acid (IC(50)=16.67microM) and l-mimosine (IC(50)=3.68microM). In addition, a comparison with other established methods was carried to prove the adequate discriminatory performance of the molecular descriptors used here.

Since γ-CAs are poorly understood at this moment, being present in carboxysomes and thus involved in photosynthesis, this study may be relevant for a better understanding of these processes in Antarctic bacteria/cyanobacteria.","Cloning, characterization and anion inhibition studies of a new γ-carbonic anhydrase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis.",Anions| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Recombinant Proteins| Carbonic Anhydrases,10.1016/j.bmc.2015.06.021,17,21,4409,,1464-3391,15,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,"Amino Acid Sequence| Anions| Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors| Carbonic Anhydrases| Cloning, Molecular| Kinetics| Molecular Sequence Data| Phylogeny| Protein Binding| Pseudoalteromonas| Recombinant Proteins| Sequence Alignment",chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| metabolism| classification| genetics| metabolism| enzymology| biosynthesis| chemistry| isolation & purification,05,07,26145820,Journal Article,4405,23,2016,2020,,,,,"Cloning, characterization and anion inhibition studies of a new γ-carbonic anhydrase from the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis",journal-article,10.1016/j.bmc.2015.06.021,,"{""MAG"": ""614444048"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.bmc.2015.06.021"", ""CorpusId"": 13079636, ""PubMed"": ""26145820""}",26145820,JournalArticle,2960cd8bb36047d80b1ee5aa76830365eb42513c,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry

A.; Trapp, S.; Wang, J.; Young, W. B.; Mackman, R. L. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 2753-2771) has been optimized through minor structural changes on the S1 binding group to afford remarkably selective and potent inhibitors of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). The trypsin-like serine proteases(1) that comprise drug targets can be broadly categorized into two subfamilies, those with Ser190 and those with Ala190. A single-atom modification, for example, replacement of hydrogen for chlorine at the 6-position of the 5-amidinoindole P1 group on 1, generated up to 6700-fold selectivity toward the Ser190 enzymes and against the Ala190 enzymes. The larger chlorine atom displaces a water molecule (H(2)O1(S1)) that binds near residue 190 in all the complexes of 1, and related inhibitors, in uPA, thrombin, and trypsin. The water molecule, H(2)O1(S1), in both the Ser190 or Ala190 enzymes, hydrogen bonds with the amidine N1 nitrogen of the inhibitor. When it is displaced, a reduction in affinity toward the Ala190 enzymes is observed due to the amidine N1 nitrogen of the bound inhibitor being deprived of a key hydrogen-bonding partner. In the Ser190 enzymes the affinity is maintained since the serine hydroxyl oxygen O gamma(Ser190) compensates for the displaced water molecule. High-resolution crystallography provided evidence for the displacement of the water molecule and validated the design rationale. In summation, a novel and powerful method for engineering selectivity toward Ser190 proteases and against Ala190 proteases without substantially increasing molecular weight is described.",Exploiting subsite S1 of trypsin-like serine proteases for selectivity: potent and selective inhibitors of urokinase-type plasminogen activator.,2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole-5-carboxamidine| 6-chloro-2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole-5-carboxamidine| Amidines| Indoles| Protease Inhibitors| trypsin-like serine protease| Water| Serine Endopeptidases| Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator,,07,10,3871,,0022-2623,23,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Amidines| Amino Acid Sequence| Animals| Crystallography, X-Ray| Hydrogen Bonding| Indoles| Male| Models, Molecular| Molecular Sequence Data| Protease Inhibitors| Protein Binding| Rats| Rats, Sprague-Dawley| Serine Endopeptidases| Structure-Activity Relationship| Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator| Water",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacokinetics| chemistry| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| chemistry,12,07,11689072,Journal Article,3856,44,2001,2019,,,,,Exploiting Subsite S1 of Trypsin-Like Serine Proteases for Selectivity:  Potent and Selective Inhibitors of Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator,journal-article,10.1021/JM010244+,,"{""MAG"": ""2005068741"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM010244+"", ""CorpusId"": 31947616, ""PubMed"": ""11689072""}",11689072,JournalArticle,a7829cd336ed03231a10ab92fbe85a4469fe6476,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Compound 3b, the N7-benzylated analogue of 3a, was also synthesized as an antitumor agent. The synthesis of 3a was accomplished via a 12-step sequence which involved the synthesis of 2-amino-4-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (10) in 5 steps from 2-acetylbutyrolactone. Protection of the 2-amino group of 10 and regioselective iodination at the 5-position followed by palladium-catalyzed coupling afforded intermediate 14 which was converted to 3a by reduction and saponification. Similar synthetic methodology was used for 3b. X-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex of 3a, DHFR, and NADPH showed that the pyrrolo[2, 3-d]pyrimidine ring binds in a ""2,4-diamino mode"" in which the pyrrole nitrogen mimics the 4-amino moiety of 2,4-diaminopyrimidines. This is the first example of a classical pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine antifolate shown to have this alternate mode of binding to DHFR. Compounds 3a and 3b were more inhibitory than LY231514 against TS from Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli. Analogue 3a was also more inhibitory against DHFR from human, Toxoplasma gondii, and Pneumocystis carinii. Evaluation of 3a against methotrexate (MTX)-resistant cell lines with defined mechanisms indicated that cross-resistance of 3a was much lower than that of MTX. Metabolite protection studies and folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase studies suggest that the antitumor activity of 3a against the growth of tumor cells in culture is a result of dual inhibition of TS and DHFR. Compound 3a inhibited the growth of CCRF-CEM and FaDu cells in culture at ED(50) values of 12.5 and 7.0 nM, respectively, and was more active against FaDu cells than MTX. In contrast, compound 3b was inactive against both cell lines. Compound 3a was evaluated in the National Cancer Institute in vitro preclinical antitumor screening program and afforded IG(50) values in the nanomolar range against a number of tumor cell lines.","Design, synthesis, and X-ray crystal structure of a potent dual inhibitor of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase as an antitumor agent.","Antineoplastic Agents| Enzyme Inhibitors| Folic Acid Antagonists| N-(2-amino-4-methyl((pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl)benzoyl)glutamic acid| Pyrimidines| Glutamic Acid| Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase| Thymidylate Synthase",,16,07,3851,,0022-2623,21,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Antineoplastic Agents| Crystallography, X-Ray| Drug Design| Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor| Enzyme Inhibitors| Escherichia coli| Folic Acid Antagonists| Glutamic Acid| Humans| Lacticaseibacillus casei| Models, Molecular| Pneumocystis| Pyrimidines| Rats| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase| Thymidylate Synthase| Toxoplasma| Tumor Cells, Cultured",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| analogs & derivatives| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| chemistry| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemistry| metabolism| antagonists & inhibitors| chemistry| chemistry,11,12,11052789,"Journal Article| Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",3837,43,2000,2022,,,,,"Design, Synthesis, and X-ray Crystal Structure of a Potent Dual Inhibitor of Thymidylate Synthase and Dihydrofolate Reductase as an Antitumor Agent",journal-article,10.1021/JM000200L,,"{""MAG"": ""1995599191"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/JM000200L"", ""CorpusId"": 33090267, ""PubMed"": ""11052789""}",11052789,JournalArticle,4427ecf4c5650deba91aeb542681bcfa3f88cc3b,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry

Importantly, 28g significantly inhibited HUVEC tube formation, proliferation, migration and invasion. The inhibitory effect against angiogenesis in vivo was confirmed by zebrafish xenograft. Furthermore, 28g could effectively suppress the proliferation and metastasis of MGC-803 cells in vitro and in zebrafish xenograft. All above results indicated that 28g can act as a promising antitumor and antiangiogenic agent via targeting tubulin and class IIa HDACs.",Discovery of novel tubulin/HDAC dual-targeting inhibitors with strong antitumor and antiangiogenic potency.,Angiogenesis Inhibitors| Antineoplastic Agents| Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors| Tubulin| Tubulin Modulators| Histone Deacetylases,10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113790,14,14,0,,1768-3254,0,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Angiogenesis Inhibitors| Animals| Antineoplastic Agents| Apoptosis| Cell Line, Tumor| Cell Proliferation| Dose-Response Relationship, Drug| Drug Discovery| Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor| Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors| Histone Deacetylases| Humans| Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial| Molecular Structure| Neoplasms, Experimental| Neovascularization, Physiologic| Polymerization| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tubulin| Tubulin Modulators| Zebrafish",chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| drug effects| drug effects| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| metabolism| drug effects| drug therapy| metabolism| pathology| drug effects| drug effects| metabolism| chemical synthesis| chemistry| pharmacology| embryology,01,01,34454126,Journal Article,113790,225,2022,2022,,,,,Discovery of novel tubulin/HDAC dual-targeting inhibitors with strong antitumor and antiangiogenic potency,journal-article,10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113790,,"{""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113790"", ""CorpusId"": 237348026, ""PubMed"": ""34454126""}",34454126,JournalArticle,2dcda55660391f523d8a0ba8e024fa428e38e628,European journal of medicinal chemistry

In contrast to what was predicted by the model, SAR around this new series was dictated by the aniline portion rather than the bicyclic portion of the molecule.","Structure based approach to the design of bicyclic-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione based androgen receptor antagonists.","Androgen Antagonists| Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic| Indoles| Protein Isoforms| Receptors, Androgen",,28,24,276,,0960-894X,2,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,"Androgen Antagonists| Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic| Indoles| Protein Isoforms| Receptors, Androgen| Structure-Activity Relationship| Tumor Cells, Cultured",chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| pharmacology| chemistry| pharmacology| metabolism,06,11,15603938,Journal Article,271,15,2005,2016,,,,,"Structure based approach to the design of bicyclic-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione based androgen receptor antagonists",journal-article,10.1016/J.BMCL.2004.10.085,,"{""MAG"": ""2136965329"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/J.BMCL.2004.10.085"", ""CorpusId"": 43739678, ""PubMed"": ""15603938""}",15603938,JournalArticle,a0c7af85c2d1932b8318d6fe82aa714507044f75,Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters

Anti-convulsant activity of both potent COX-2 inhibitors was assessed in sc-PTZ induced seizure test and MTL-1 excellently protected animals against PTZ induced seizure at the dose of 30 mg/kg. MTL-1 also indicates long duration of action in time course study and displayed significant seizure protection up to 6 h of drug administration. Further, the anti-epileptogenic effect of MTL-1 has been examined in PTZ induced chronic model of epilepsy. The results indicated that MTL-1 had a significant anti-epileptogenic effect in PTZ kindled rats as compared to Etoricoxib (ETX) and PTZ alone treated group. Additionally, MTL-1 successfully improved cognition deficit in PTZ kindled rats, which was confirmed by social recognition, novel object recognition and light-dark chamber tests. Moreover, molecular docking and molecular simulation (MD simulation) studies were also performed to elucidate the interaction of MTL-1 with the active site of COX-2 and results showed that MTL-1 suitably binds within active site of COX-2. To investigate the safety profile of MTL-1, a sub-acute toxicity study was also performed and MTL-1 emerged as a new non-toxic chemical entity. Thus, the present investigation discovered a potent and safe COX-2 inhibitor, which is endowed with an effective anti-epileptic action.","Discovery of novel Methylsulfonyl phenyl derivatives as potent human Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors with effective anticonvulsant action: Design, synthesis, in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation.",Anticonvulsants| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Sulfinic Acids| Cyclooxygenase 2| Pentylenetetrazole,10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.04.007,22,22,532,,1768-3254,0,European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Animals| Anticonvulsants| Cyclooxygenase 2| Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors| Drug Design| Epilepsy| Humans| Male| Methylation| Molecular Docking Simulation| Pentylenetetrazole| Rats| Rats, Wistar| Seizures| Sulfinic Acids",chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use| metabolism| chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use| chemically induced| drug therapy| enzymology| chemically induced| drug therapy| enzymology| chemistry| pharmacology| therapeutic use,05,05,29655084,Journal Article,520,151,2018,2018,,,,,"Discovery of novel Methylsulfonyl phenyl derivatives as potent human Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors with effective anticonvulsant action: Design, synthesis, in-silico, in-vitro and in-vivo evaluation",journal-article,10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.04.007,,"{""MAG"": ""2796117823"", ""DOI"": ""10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.04.007"", ""CorpusId"": 4878107, ""PubMed"": ""29655084""}",29655084,JournalArticle,98853391390a420a05d3d8dae132ac1b0bf4460a,European journal of medicinal chemistry

Finally, in vivo pharmacology evaluations of 3m showed significant antitumor activity (TGI = 66.1%) in NCI-H1581 NSCLC xenografts with a good pharmacokinetic profile.","Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Evaluation of Novel Multisubstituted Pyridin-3-amine Derivatives as Multitargeted Protein Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.",4-fluoro-2-(5-(2-hydroxy-1-phenylethylamino)-3-(3-methyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyridin-2-yl)phenol| Aminopyridines| Antineoplastic Agents| Indazoles| Protein Kinase Inhibitors| Pyridines| Protein-Tyrosine Kinases,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00076,05,30,6035,,1520-4804,14,Journal of medicinal chemistry,"Aminopyridines| Animals| Antineoplastic Agents| Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung| Cell Line, Tumor| Cell Proliferation| Databases, Chemical| Drug Design| Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor| Female| Heterografts| Humans| Indazoles| Lung Neoplasms| Mice| Mice, Nude| Molecular Docking Simulation| Neoplasm Transplantation| Phosphorylation| Protein Kinase Inhibitors| Protein-Tyrosine Kinases| Pyridines| Rats, Sprague-Dawley| Signal Transduction| Stereoisomerism| Structure-Activity Relationship",chemical synthesis| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| chemical synthesis| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| drug therapy| drug effects| chemical synthesis| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| drug therapy| chemical synthesis| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology| antagonists & inhibitors| metabolism| chemical synthesis| pharmacokinetics| pharmacology,09,12,28714692,"Journal Article| Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",6018,60,2017,2018,,,,,"Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Evaluation of Novel Multisubstituted Pyridin-3-amine Derivatives as Multitargeted Protein Kinase Inhibitors for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer",journal-article,10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00076,,"{""MAG"": ""2705073396"", ""DOI"": ""10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b00076"", ""CorpusId"": 2279016, ""PubMed"": ""28714692""}",28714692,JournalArticle,0eedad8501c06e33ef1d68e0102491794ca761da,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry
