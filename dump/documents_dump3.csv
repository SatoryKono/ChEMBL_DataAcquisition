CHEMBL1126311,"Novel functional M1 selective muscarinic agonists. 2. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 3-pyrazinyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridines. Construction of a molecular model for the M1 pharmacophore.","A series of 3-(3-substituted-pyrazinyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-methylpyridines were synthesized and found to have high affinity for central muscarinic receptors. The ability of some of these compounds to inhibit the electrically stimulated twitch of the guinea pig vas deferens indicated that the compounds were M1 agonists. M1 agonist activity was related to the length of the side chain attached to the pyrazine ring, with maximal activity being obtained with the hexyloxy side chain. The (hexyloxy)pyrazine 3f lacked M2 agonist activity as it failed to affect the guinea pig atria and was also relatively devoid of M3 agonist activity as determined by its lack of tremorogenic and sialogogic effects in mice.

CHEMBL1125335,Effects of alkyl substitutions of xanthine skeleton on bronchodilation.,"Structure-activity relationships in a series of 1,3,7-trialkyl-xanthine were studied with guinea pigs. Relaxant actions in the tracheal muscle were increased with alkyl chain length at the 1- and 3-positions of the xanthine skeleton, but decreased by alkylation at the 7-position. Positive chronotropic actions in the right atrium were potentiated with 3-alkyl chain length but tended to decrease with 1-alkylation and diminish by 7-substitution. Consequently, while the 1- and 3-substitutions were equally important for the tracheal smooth muscle relaxation, the substitution at the 1-position was more important than the 3-substitution for bronchoselectivity. The 7-alkylation may be significant to cancel heart stimulation. There were good correlations between the smooth muscle relaxant action and the cyclic AMP-PDE inhibitory activity in 3-substituents and the affinity for adenosine (A1) receptors in 1-, 3-, and 7-substituents. This suggests that not only the cyclic AMP-PDE inhibitory activity but also the adenosine antagonistic activity is important in the bronchodilatory effects of alkylxanthines.

However, while 7 was more selective than either TMQ (19x) or PTX (63x) against this enzyme, its selectivity in comparison with TMP was 8-fold lower. 2,4-Diamino-6-[3',4',5'-trimethoxyanilino)methyl]pyrido[3,2-d]pyri midin e (6) was 17-fold less active than 7 and was also less selective. 2,4-Diamino-6-[(3',4'-dichloro-N-methylanilino)methyl]pyrido[3, 2-d]pyrimidine (10) had an IC50 of 0.022 microM against P. carinii DHFR and was comparable in potency to TMQ and PTX. The species selectivity of 10 for P. carinii versus rat liver DHFR was greater than that of either TMQ (21-fold) or PTX (31-fold). On the other hand, even though 10 was slightly more active than TMQ against the P. carinii enzyme, its selectivity was 7-fold lower than that of TMP.

CHEMBL1129285,Conformationally constrained analogues of diacylglycerol. 10. Ultrapotent protein kinase C ligands based on a racemic 5-disubstituted tetrahydro-2-furanone template.,"5,5-Bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone and its isomer 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone were investigated as possible templates for the construction of conformationally constrained analogues of the biologically important second messenger, diacylglycerol (DAG). The former lactone contains embedded within its structure an exact glycerol moiety, while in the latter the ring oxygen has been transposed to the other side of the carbonyl group. All target compounds were synthesized as racemates from 1,3-dihydroxy-2-propanone. The 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone proved to be the better template for the construction of DAG surrogates that were demonstrated to have high binding affinities for the biological target, protein kinase C (PK-C). The simplest target compounds derived from this template (3e and 3f) have one of the hydroxyl moieties functionalized either as a myristate or as an oleate ester. The simplest target compound (9c) derived from the ineffective 4,4-bis-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template was investigated only with a myristoyl acyl chain. Reducing the long acyl chain to an acetyl moiety and attaching a compensating lipophilic chain to the lactone ring as an alpha-alkylidene moiety produced compounds 10e and 10f (Z-isomers) and 11e and 11f (E-isomers), which were constructed on the more effective 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template. Targets 14c (Z-isomer) and 15c (E-isomer) were derived, in turn, from 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone. The affinities of these ligands for PK-C were assessed in terms of their ability to displace bound [3H-20]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) from the single isozyme PK-C alpha. The biological data support the hypothesis that the increase in binding affinity for PK-C shown by some of these constrained DAG mimetics appears to be entropic in nature. Two of the designed ligands (10e and 10f) showed the highest affinities (34 and 24 nM, respectively) reported so far for a DAG analogue.

The former lactone contains embedded within its structure an exact glycerol moiety, while in the latter the ring oxygen has been transposed to the other side of the carbonyl group. All target compounds were synthesized as racemates from 1,3-dihydroxy-2-propanone. The 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone proved to be the better template for the construction of DAG surrogates that were demonstrated to have high binding affinities for the biological target, protein kinase C (PK-C). The simplest target compounds derived from this template (3e and 3f) have one of the hydroxyl moieties functionalized either as a myristate or as an oleate ester. The simplest target compound (9c) derived from the ineffective 4,4-bis-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template was investigated only with a myristoyl acyl chain. Reducing the long acyl chain to an acetyl moiety and attaching a compensating lipophilic chain to the lactone ring as an alpha-alkylidene moiety produced compounds 10e and 10f (Z-isomers) and 11e and 11f (E-isomers), which were constructed on the more effective 5,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template. Targets 14c (Z-isomer) and 15c (E-isomer) were derived, in turn, from 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone. The affinities of these ligands for PK-C were assessed in terms of their ability to displace bound [3H-20]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) from the single isozyme PK-C alpha. The biological data support the hypothesis that the increase in binding affinity for PK-C shown by some of these constrained DAG mimetics appears to be entropic in nature. Two of the designed ligands (10e and 10f) showed the highest affinities (34 and 24 nM, respectively) reported so far for a DAG analogue.

Ultrapotent protein kinase C ligands based on a chiral 5-disubstituted tetrahydro-2-furanone template.,"Conformationally constrained analogues of diacylglycerol (DAG) built on a racemic 5(-)[(acyloxy)-methyl]-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2-furanone template were shown previously to have excellent binding affinities for protein kinase C (PK-C). Since the interaction of PK-C with DAG is stereospecific, it was anticipated that PK-C would bind tightly to only one enantiomeric form of the compounds constructed with this new lactone template. Separation of enantiomers by chiral HPLC was discarded due to the ease with which acyl migration occurs in these class of compounds, and a total chiral synthesis was undertaken. Prior to chemical synthesis, the selection of the ""correct"" enantiomeric template was predicted by a molecular conformational analysis that compared the two enantiomers of DAG in their presumed ""active"" conformation with the two enantiomeric lactone templates. This presumed ""active"" conformation for DAG was derived from a previously developed pharmacophore model that uses the molecule of a potent phorbol diester as the ideal rigid template. The results from this analysis indicated that the ""correct"" lactone template corresponded to the inactive (R)-isomer of DAG. This analysis also predicted that the lactone template corresponding to the active (S)-DAG enantiomer would not fit adequately into the pharmacophore. The chiral syntheses of target compounds 2, 4, and 6, constructed on the selected, and presumably ""correct"" lactone template, were achieved from a common bicyclic intermediate (5R,8R,9R)-8,9-O-isopropylidene-2-keto-1,7-dioxaspiro[4.4]nonane (10) that was synthesized from commercially available 1,2:3,5-di-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-threo-apiofuranose (7) by a very effective spirolactonization approach. On the basis of their ability to inhibit the binding of [3H-20]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBU) to PK-C alpha, the enantiomeric ligands 2, 4, and 6 were twice as potent as the corresponding racemates.

All the analogs were evaluated for displacement of [3H]WIN 35,428 binding at the dopamine transporter and for inhibition of [3H]dopamine uptake in rat caudate putamen. Compounds were observed to monophasically displace [3H]WIN 35,428 binding to the dopamine transporter with affinities of 21.6-1836 nM (Ki). Generally, meta-substituted compounds were more potent than benztropine and equipotent to or slightly less potent than their previously reported para-substituted homologs in inhibiting [3H]WIN 35,428 binding.

The analogs were also tested for binding at norepinephrine and serotonin transporters as well as muscarinic m1 receptors.

CHEMBL1130409,Hydrazide-containing inhibitors of HIV-1 integrase.,"Inhibitors of HIV integrase are currently being sought as potential new therapeutics for the treatment of AIDS. A large number of inhibitors discovered to date contain the o-bis-hydroxy catechol structure. In an effort to discover structural leads for the development of new HIV integrase inhibitors which do not rely on this potentially cytotoxic catechol substructure, NSC 310217 was identified using a three-point pharmacophore search based on its assigned structure N-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-N-(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)hydrazine (1). When a sample of NSC 310217 was obtained from the NCI repository, it was shown to exhibit potent inhibition of HIV-1 integrase (3'-processing IC50 = 0.6 microgram/mL). In work reported herein, we demonstrate that NSC 310217, rather than containing 1, which has no inhibitory potency against HIV-1 integrase, is comprised of roughly a 1:1 mixture of N-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-N'-(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)hydrazine (6) and N,N'-bis-salicylhydrazine 7, with all inhibitory potency residing with compound 7(IC50 = 0.7 microM for strand transfer). In subsequent structure-activity studies on 7, it is shown that removing a single amide carbonyl (compound 14, IC50 = 5.2 microM) or replacing one aromatic ring system with a naphthyl ring (compound 19, IC50 = 1.1 microM) can be accomplished with little loss of inhibitory potency. Additionally, replacing a single hydroxyl with a sulfhydryl (compound 23, IC50 = 5.8 microM) results in only moderate loss of potency. All other modifications examined, including the replacement of a single hydroxyl with an amino group (compound 22), resulted in complete loss of potency.

CHEMBL1130410,19-nor-10-azasteroids: a novel class of inhibitors for human steroid 5alpha-reductases 1 and 2.,"Steroid 5alpha-reductase is a system of two isozymes (5alphaR-1 and 5alphaR-2) which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in many androgen sensitive tissues and which is related to several human endocrine diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic cancer, acne, alopecia, pattern baldness in men and hirsutism in women. The discovery of new potent and selective 5alphaR inhibitors is thus of great interest for pharmaceutical treatment of these diseases. The synthesis of a novel class of inhibitors for human 5alphaR-1 and 5alphaR-2, having the 19-nor-10-azasteroid skeleton, is described. The inhibitory potency of the 19-nor-10-azasteroids was determined in homogenates of human hypertrophic prostates toward 5alphaR-2 and in DU-145 human prostatic adenocarcinoma cells toward 5alphaR-1, in comparison with finasteride (IC50 = 3 nM for 5alphaR-2 and approximately 42 nM for 5alphaR-1), a drug which is currently used for BPH treatment. The inhibition potency was dependent on the type of substituent at position 17 and on the presence and position of the unsaturation in the A and C rings. delta9(11)-19-Nor-10-azaandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (or 10-azaestra-4,9(11)-diene-3,17-dione) (4a) and 19-nor-10-azaandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione (5) were weak inhibitors of 5alphaR-2 (IC50 = 4.6 and 4.4 microM, respectively) but more potent inhibitors of 5alphaR-1 (IC50 = 263 and 299 nM, respectively), whereas 19-nor-10-aza-5alpha-androstane-3,17-dione (7) was inactive for both the isoenzymes. The best result was achieved with the 9:1 mixture of delta9(11)- and delta8(9)-17beta-(N-tert-butylcarbamoyl)-19-nor-10-aza-4- androsten-3-one (10a,b) which was a good inhibitor of 5alphaR-1 and 5alphaR-2 (IC50 = 127 and 122 nM, respectively), with a potency very close to that of finasteride. The results of ab initio calculations suggest that the inhibition potency of 19-nor-10-azasteroids could be directly related to the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl group in the 3-position.",10.1021/jm960807v,1997,J Med Chem,,40,7,1112,1129,9089333,"Guarna A, Belle C, Machetti F, Occhiato EG, Payne AH, Cassiani C, Comerci A, Danza G, De Bellis A, Dini S, Marrucci A, Serio M.",,9089333,,19-nor-10-azasteroids: a novel class of inhibitors for human steroid 5alpha-reductases 1 and 2.,"Steroid 5alpha-reductase is a system of two isozymes (5alphaR-1 and 5alphaR-2) which catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in many androgen sensitive tissues and which is related to several human endocrine diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatic cancer, acne, alopecia, pattern baldness in men and hirsutism in women.
