CHEMBL4334432,Development of benzochalcone derivatives as selective CYP1B1 inhibitors and anticancer agents.,"A series of benzochalcone derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for CYP1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxic properties against wild type cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and drug resistant cell lines (LCC6/P-gp and MCF-7/1B1). All of these compounds were found to have selective inhibition towards CYP1B1 and the most potent two possessed single-digit nanomolar CYP1B1 potency. In addition, some of them showed promising cytotoxic activities not only against wild type cells, but also against drug resistant cells at low micromolar concentrations. More importantly, these multi-functional compounds may surmount drug-drug interactions that frequently occur during the combination of CYP1B1/P-gp inhibitors and anticancer drugs to overcome drug resistance. This study may provide a good starting point for the further development of more potent multi-functional agents with CYP1B1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxic potency in cancer prevention and treatment.",10.1039/C9MD00258H,2019,Medchemcomm,,10,9,1606,1614,31803401,"Dong J, Huang G, Zhang Q, Wang Z, Cui J, Wu Y, Meng Q, Li S.",,31803401,10.1039/c9md00258h,Development of benzochalcone derivatives as selective CYP1B1 inhibitors and anticancer agents.,"A series of benzochalcone derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for CYP1 inhibitory activity and cytotoxic properties against wild type cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and drug resistant cell lines (LCC6/P-gp and MCF-7/1B1).

CHEMBL4725304,Synthesis and evaluations of selective COX-2 inhibitory effects: Benzo[d]thiazol analogs.,"A series of benzo[d]thiazole analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Using an ear edema model, except for compounds 2k, 2m-2q and 3a, other compounds showed the anti-inflammatory effects. Among them, compounds 2c, 2d, and 2g showed the best anti-inflammatory activity (inhibition rate: 86.8%, 90.7% and 82.9%, respectively). By the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test, except for compounds 2e, 2l, 2m, 2o, 2p and 3a, other compounds showed the analgesic effects with inhibition rate values of 51.9-100% (2a-2r) and 68.6-100% (3a-3g). Next, compounds 2c, 2d, 2g, 3d, 3f, 3g that displayed the excellent anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities were evaluated for their inhibitory effect against ovine COX-1 and COX-2. Compounds 2c, 2d, 2g, 3d, 3f, 3g were weak inhibitors of the COX-1 isozyme but exhibited the moderate COX-2 isozyme inhibitory effects IC from 0.28 to 0.77Â Î¼M and COX-2 selectivity indexes (SI: 18.6 to 7.2).
